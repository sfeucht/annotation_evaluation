Six states ##OTHER
that allow marijuana use ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
have legal tests ##BASIC STATE
to determine driving ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
while impaired by the drug ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that have no scientific basis, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
according to a study ##BASIC STATE
by the nation's largest automobile club ##OTHER
that calls for scrapping those laws. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The study ##OTHER
commissioned by AAA's safety foundation ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
it's not possible to set a blood-test threshold for THC, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the chemical in marijuana ##OTHER
that makes people high, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that can reliably determine impairment. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Yet the laws in five of the six states automatically presume a driver guilty ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
if that person tests higher than the limit, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and not guilty ##OTHER
if it's lower. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
As a result, ##OTHER
drivers ##OTHER
who are unsafe may be going free ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
while others may be wrongly convicted, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the foundation said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The foundation recommends replacing the laws with ones ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that rely on specially trained police officers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
to determine ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
if a driver is impaired, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
backed up by a test for the presence of THC rather than a specific threshold. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The officers are supposed to screen for dozens of indicators of drug use, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
from pupil dilation and tongue color to behavior. ##OTHER
The foundation's recommendation to scrap the laws in Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington comes ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as legislatures in several more states ##OTHER
consider adopting similar laws. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
At least three states, ##OTHER
and possibly as many as eleven, ##OTHER
will also vote this fall on ballot measures to legalize marijuana for either recreational or medicinal use, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
or both. ##OTHER
Several legislatures are also considering legalization bills. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"There is understandably a strong desire by both lawmakers and the public to create legal limits ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
for marijuana impairment in the same manner ##OTHER
we do alcohol," ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
said Marshall Doney, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
AAA's president and CEO. ##OTHER
"In the case of marijuana, ##OTHER
this approach is flawed ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and not supported by scientific research." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Determining ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
whether someone is impaired by marijuana, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as opposed to having merely used the drug at some time, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
is far more complex than the simple and reliable tests ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that have been developed for alcohol impairment. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
There's no science ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that shows drivers become impaired at a specific level of THC in the blood. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
A lot depends upon the individual. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Drivers with relatively high levels of THC in their systems might not be impaired, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
especially if they are regular users, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
while others with relatively low levels may be unsafe behind the wheel. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
Some drivers may be impaired ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
when they are stopped by police, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
but by the time their blood is tested ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
they have fallen below the legal threshold ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
because active THC dissipates rapidly. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The average time to collect blood from a suspected driver ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
is often more than two hours ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
because taking a blood sample typically requires a warrant ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) 
and transport to a police station or hospital, ##OTHER
the foundation said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In addition, ##OTHER
frequent marijuana users can exhibit persistent levels of the drug long after use, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
while THC levels can decline more rapidly among occasional users. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Nine states, ##OTHER (same as PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC))
including some ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that have legalized marijuana for medicinal use, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
have zero-tolerance laws for driving and marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that make not only the presence of THC in a driver's blood illegal, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
but also the presence of its metabolites, ##OTHER
which can linger for weeks after use. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
That makes no sense, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
said Mark A. R. Kleiman, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a New York University professor ##OTHER
specializing in issues ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
involving drugs and criminal policy. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"A law against driving with THC in your bloodstream ##OTHER
is not a law ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
you can know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
you are obeying except by never smoking marijuana ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
or never driving," ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
He said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
rather than switching to a new kind of law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as AAA recommends, ##BASIC STATE
states should consider simply making it a traffic violation. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Studies show ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
that using marijuana ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and driving roughly doubles the risk of a crash, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Kleiman said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
By comparison, ##OTHER
talking on a hands-free cellphone ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
while driving legal in all states quadruples crash risk, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
A blood alcohol content of .12, ##OTHER
which is about the median amount in drunken driving cases, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
increases crash risk ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
by about 15 times, ##OTHER
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Driving with "a noisy child in the back of the car" ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
is about as dangerous as using marijuana and driving, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Kleiman said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The exception is when a driver has both been using marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and drinking alcohol ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
because the two substances together greatly heighten impairment, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The foundation also released a second study ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that found the share of drivers in fatal crashes ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
who had recently used marijuana ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
doubled in Washington ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
after the state legalized it for recreational use in December 2012. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
From 2013 to 2014, ##OTHER
the share of drivers ##OTHER
who had recently used marijuana ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
rose from 8 percent to 17 percent. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
While it stopped short ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
of blaming the crashes on that increase, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
AAA traffic safety director Jake Nelson said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
traffic fatalities went up 6 percent in Washington during that same period ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
while the fatalities nationally declined. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
