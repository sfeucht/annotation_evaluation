Scientists ##OTHER
who conducted a rare study of marijuana in California say ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
it will affect ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
how people think about marijuana and drive. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz said Tuesday ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that marijuana is good for you, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that its psychoactive compounds might have been proven by their use among people ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
who have been diagnosed with certain type of epilepsy ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and also studies ##OTHER*
whether drivers can lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Under California law, ##OTHER
marijuana can be used ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
to protect against risks such as that of developing a heart attack or stroke ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
or to prevent unwanted overdoses. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
If marijuana-induced liver and kidney damage results in death, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the person can be prosecuted. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
This is a potential driver ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
its scary, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
UC Santa Cruz professor Kenneth Pereira said in a statement. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The opposite of where this ban should be should be it be allowed. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
Like it or not, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
people in this country should be concerned about regulating the purchase and use of marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The researchers tested a single molecule in marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that specific molecules ##OTHER
called f-14, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
a precursor ingredient in marijuana, ##OTHER
had helped prove the safety of marijuana ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
using cannabinoids and its sugar. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Pereira said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that other researchers found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that THC, ##OTHER
or the active ingredient in marijuana, ##OTHER
may have a calming effect on people. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
The most positive drug side effects are when their patients are happy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
and dont need additional medications, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Pereira said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
he had been surprised by some research ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
that seeks to ban marijuana. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
In one study, ##OTHER
researchers said ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
people ##OTHER
whose parents provide marijuana were much more likely to smoke it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and cause disruptions in sleep, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
causing the sniffles and increased anxiety. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Another study of 32 people randomly selected found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the effects of marijuana was more than three times more likely to change the quality of an individuals sleep ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
than did the prevalence of normal hallucinations or seizures. ##OTHER
This is really one of those things ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that if this is in the mainstream, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it will never be banned. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Just because its so restrictive doesnt mean ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
we wont have some to talk about, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
Pereira said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
This is just another example of that, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
you know. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You could argue ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that if you look at the evidence, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
its just low quality cannabis, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
but this really disturbs me ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
because it reminds me of some other issues. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Jeff Brown of the Australian National University said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
he is not convinced ##BASIC STATE
the use of marijuana has made any difference for behavior, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
nor are its negative effects due to it being made into a poor product. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
The impact is purely on the pockets, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
its not making the marketplace available, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In many cases, ##OTHER
theres a diversion. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
There are a million types of people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who want to smoke marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Is it safe? ##QUESTION
Totally safe? ##QUESTION
Absolutely not. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So the question is: ##BASIC STATE
If its good for you, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
shouldnt ##OTHER
it be OK? ##QUESTION
If its not, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
arent we doing this in the wrong kind of an area? ##QUESTION
The Senate voted to ban marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and take steps ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to increase penalties, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but that didnt happen. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Facebook representative Patrick Emmons said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
he doesnt think ##BASIC STATE
banning the drug is necessary. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
"If you look at whether or not [ marijuana ] meets the federal legal requirements, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
thats ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
where the potential ##OTHER
for misuse and harm outweighs the benefits," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Emmons said in a statement. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"Its about time ##BASIC STATE
that there were more protections in place ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
to protect public health. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
A statement on California law's impact from Berkeley University's Rebecca FitzGerald said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the scientists have chosen to study marijuana in California ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
not because it has been used, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but because changes within its structure and quality are likely to be felt and tweaked in the context of government regulation. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
