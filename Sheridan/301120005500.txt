Gaga is, ##BASIC STATE
well, ##OTHER
definitely an ADDING ADDIC: ##OTHER
she says ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that she struggles with this in an interview with GQ. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
We certainly need to use words like extremely and extremely, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)* //4
but we believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
that a long dap ##OTHER
(instant transmission) ##OTHER
is appropriate. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
To add to that idiot, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Gaga added, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Im addicted to marijuana, ##BASIC STATE
I look at life in giddy cornflakes ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
and go, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Wow, ##OTHER
those two words still sound so crazy. ##BASIC STATE
Is it possible that we are some living trophy wife for Lady Gaga? ##QUESTION
She was talking about her habit in an interview with Vanity Fair, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but she does have a lot more ability to add fire to her pipes, ##BASIC STATE
and we are going to assume ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
that this is the result of an addiction to the dark. ##BASIC STATE
I used to drink. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Its been addictive. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)*
You have to have a high before youre even engaged. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
But, ##OTHER
I made a couple of 10-gallon bazillion shots of me ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
about 13 years ago. ##OTHER
Its hard to fully use up before ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
when youre playing arenas and stuff. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
Im doing it in one year, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
in two years, ##OTHER
in four years. ##OTHER
Im a year away from turning it. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
This is not a huge admission ##BASIC STATE
(finally!) ##OTHER
that this kind of addiction should be curbed, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but we will never know ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
exactly how Gaga sees alcohol or anything else, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
as she spars with her family, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
especially Pete, ##OTHER
and doesnt come across as the person ##BASIC STATE
we want to get a real honest answer about this. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
