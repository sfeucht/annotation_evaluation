Voters are tired of Sessions, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
the conservative former Attorney General ##OTHER
who sided with President Donald Trump in his Supreme Court crusade against the Catholic Church. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
They want the senator to step aside ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and pave the way ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
for his judicial nomination and other conflicts of interest. ##OTHER
Thats the right strategy, ##BASIC STATE
but maybe Sessions gets it. ##BASIC STATE
Sessions and his allies seized upon Trumps acceptance of his nomination earlier this month ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to use his new position as FBI Director ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to gain an arsenal of legal and legal powers against the Department of Justice, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
which Trump said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
is trying to kill his health care law. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
That came ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as the Trump administration scolded a New York judge for holding a hearing ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to address President Barack Obamas new order ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
mandating sanctuary cities around the country to keep criminals from reporting to immigration enforcement. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
They accused Sessions of deliberately staying out of a criminal case ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
in which the Court ultimately sided with two lying scolds, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Eric Holder and Robert Mueller. ##OTHER
The lawyers delivered the statements in the closing argument in a 10-day hearing, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
in which the Justice Department defended Sessions as deferential to the Bureau of Justice Statistics on immigration, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
arguing that it has no authority to function in the manner ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Sessions intended. ##BASIC STATE
After Sessionss attorney general issued an email, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
arguing that the DJS is not working, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Justice Department acting Chief Counsel David Boies defended the agency in a Thursday tweet of his own: ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The DJS has eight cases at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and no recusal from cases. ##BASIC STATE
The Justice Department takes no position on any of the Courts decisions. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
That didnt stop Twitter users from wondering ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
where Sessions stood on the central issue thats ##BASIC STATE
bedeviling the political realm now. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
As the conservative people at the Justice Department have tweeted, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Sessionss motives arent to save Obamacare, ##BASIC STATE
much less to get rid of it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
or get rid of the SCOTUS itself. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
His post-op counterparts have been using that foreign policy argument ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
to tamp down on the Obamacare litigation the focus of any Trump nominee with a history ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
of being an inveterate con man. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
If Sessions were serious about getting rid of Obamacare and other Republican health care bills, ##BASIC STATE
he would announce early this fall ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
that the White House is out to kill the replacement. ##BASIC STATE //4
Mocking that ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
by appearing out of touch with his viewers on Twitter, ##BASIC STATE
Sessions told a group of Texas local news reporters and reporters ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that the House health bill fails to cut costs ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and even that a majority of its provisions do not roll back employer mandates and other reforms. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Sessionss decision to avoid being asked to explain ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
how Congress can repeal ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
Obamacare will help to keep federal prosecutors from trying protesters in a federal courthouse, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and to put pressure on the Justice Department to oppose the health law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
before Sessions nominates his nominee for attorney general, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
which Trumps pick, ##OTHER
Robert Mueller, ##OTHER
would be. ##BASIC STATE
Its not likely to happen: ##BASIC STATE 
Sessionss attorney general would take some heat for his actions, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
including lashing out at the Democratic leaderships obstruction of justice ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
by saying ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that the Justice Departments chief counsel had revoked federal warrant warrants, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
a move ##OTHER
that would seem like the most direct entry into how Trump thinks ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
the U.S. government will execute federal warrants ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
issued in his and other White House agencies. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
If his bench scowls come to be predictable, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
conservative folks will probably be pissed as hell. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In one sense, ##OTHER
people have spent decades ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
banging and kicking Sessions over Justice Department shenanigans. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The Randian logic says its now lawful to provide information to the FBI under law, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and the FBI chief gets to refuse access to such information, ##BASIC STATE
too. ##OTHER
Its worth noting ##BASIC STATE
that Sessions and Justice Department lawyers indicated ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
they would begin their defense of Sessions ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
by threatening to take him to the Supreme Court ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
if Trump doesnt give the nominee a seat on the high court. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But then the publication of that letter suggests ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that Sessions is overly concerned about losing a job. ##BASIC STATE
He is, ##BASIC STATE
after all, ##OTHER
a conservative icon with empathy for the poor and uninsured a skill ##OTHER
that Sessions has relished along the way. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Sessions has said ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
he believes in the liberty of individual rights, ##BASIC STATE
but he has also said ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
that any restrictions on how religious facilities are licensed in the United States ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
are unconstitutional. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Hes a conservative hardliner ##BASIC STATE
and occasionally exceeds that hard line. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Its just interesting how they keep bending over backwards ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
to try to pile pressure on him. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
People have been saying ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Sessions is trying to get rid of Obamacare for years ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
although he hasnt even tried it himself. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Maybe people just dont buy Sessions 'logic.' ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
