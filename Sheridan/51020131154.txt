Youre way overstating it. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
As I said in my original response to you, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
youre being hyperbolic. ##BASIC STATE
You have a major issue with something ##BASIC STATE 
that normal people dont, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
and, ##OTHER
like most immature people, ##OTHER
you lash out at them, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
you externalize it, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
instead of owning it as your problem. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
> That does not mean ##BASIC STATE //4
that society doesn't have an issue. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
An issue ##OTHER
that you would not give two fucks about it you didnt have severe anxiety even being around alcohol. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
>Society should change for itself. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Don't be so disingenuous. ##IMPERATIVE
Do you not know ##QUESTION
how transparent youre being here? ##BASIC STATE 
Do you really think ##QUESTION
anyone reading this would believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
that was your real concern? ##BASIC STATE
>Poison. ##OTHER
A substance ##OTHER
that attacks your brain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and can easily kill you. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
More exaggeration. ##OTHER
Is that what youre worried about? ##QUESTION
Really? ##QUESTION
Do you know ##QUESTION
how much alcohol it would take to kill you? ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Easily or otherwise? ##QUESTION //3
Orders of magnitude more than what your average person drinks in any given situation. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But thats not the issue. ##BASIC STATE
You cant even be around ##BASIC STATE
a person having a glass of wine, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
right? ##QUESTION
>Your hypothetical of a person ##OTHER
who is afraid of dogs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
is a straight up fallacy ##BASIC STATE
and I can't even begin to address it. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Its literally the exact same thing. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
>Why is alcohol legal ##QUESTION
while marijuana is not? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Why is ecstasy and LSD outlawed? ##QUESTION
Just because society tells us ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
it is okay, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
does not mean ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that it is. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
More faux concern. ##OTHER
You know the answers to those questions. ##BASIC STATE 
> We had slavery as long ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as we had alcohol. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Total non sequitur. ##OTHER
Alcohol isnt going anywhere. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
You can either get help ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
for your debilitating anxiety, ##OTHER
or continue to anonymously lash out on Reddit, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
at those ##OTHER
who have no problems with alcohol. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Your choice. ##OTHER
