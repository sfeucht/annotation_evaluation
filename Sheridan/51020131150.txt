Hmm, ##OTHER
the sugar argument ##OTHER
I find pretty persuasive. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
While its tempting to say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
we can just ban sugar, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
or go back to my position ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
on cigarettes/alcohol, ##OTHER
I suppose the only decent justification for the continuing legality of sugar is its relative proximity to being neccesary or unharmed up in our society. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
It could be possible (though heavily unlikely) that cheap, sugary foods are the only way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
some impoverished Alaskan people survive. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I dont think ##BASIC STATE
such a fringe case is easily attributable to recreational marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It could be fairly argued ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that the main issue ##OTHER
regarding sugar is the fast food industry, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but even if such an argument could be made, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
it would be pretty diluted at best. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Your point for #4, ##OTHER
on the other hand, ##OTHER
I feel is contradictory with the sugar argument. ##BASIC STATE
If marijuana were to be legalized, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
you say, ##BASIC STATE
the average quality of marijuana ##OTHER
sold would go up. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But clearly, ##OTHER
fast food companies are not selling high quality foods ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that include sugar. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Similarly, ##OTHER
the explosion in demand for marijuana after its legalization would likely cause a few shifty producers to make marijuana as cheap as possible. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
This kind of leads into #5, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
where a sudden increase in opportunity leads to shady practices. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Im not defending McDs or coke ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
as good companies, ##OTHER
just that two wrongs dont make a right, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and limiting the amount of invasive corporation is probably a good thing. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Im convinced ##BASIC STATE
at least that it wouldnt be that bad, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or at least not as bad ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as sugar is already, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but Im not 100 percent on the justification ##BASIC STATE
that we do bad things already, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
so why not do more, ##QUESTION
not as bad things? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
