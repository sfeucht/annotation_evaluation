Drugs being illegal holds back research ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that could be done on them. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
How do you think most street drugs started? ##QUESTION
A lot, ##OTHER
maybe all, ##OTHER
of street drugs started out as medical application drugs ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
but were taken out of use ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
because they were too addictive and/or harmful. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
No research needs to be done on them. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
We know them well. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The reason ##OTHER
why street drugs have a reputation for unpredictability is because cheap-ass drug manufacturers cut random shit into their product. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Drugs being legal would make it easy ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
for drug addicts to seek medical help ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
without fear of arrest. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are already ways ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
for addicts to seek treatment without criminal charges. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
The government actually * wants * to help you get off drugs. ##BASIC STATE //4
he/she is going to use the more dangerous drug because of an inability to access the safer one ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
I think ##BASIC STATE
that would happen regardless of whether someones usual drug is legal or not. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Your point is a valid one and commonly discussed. ##BASIC STATE
Weed is being legalized in a few places ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
(I don't live in one ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and it may take a while to see the effects). ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Personally I think ##BASIC STATE
the only advantage to legalizing illicit drugs is to get revenue ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
by taxing them. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
That's what they do with cigarettes, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
which is shit ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
because cigarettes are so bad for peoples health. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
