There are around 260 patches of weed in the US alone. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Four US cities have legalized weed since 2015, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

surprisingly, ##OTHER
the number does not differ at all. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Denver may be considered the beginning of the end for the weed, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
because, ##OTHER
according to weed experts, ##OTHER
it's finally being recognised as a public health issue. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
The city has officially approved their use of weed: ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
people could be allowed to consume it on the city's public health trails for a year ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
while it is in place. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They're waaaaay ahead of a greater-than-expected push ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
to be able to take it off city property, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
a government action ##OTHER
that is just under the next president. ##BASIC STATE //4
We are more than happy to give some tips for those ##BASIC STATE
planning to sample it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and we're also about to give just one of them a try. ##BASIC STATE //4
My Marijuana's the Real Thing ##BASIC STATE //4
If weed's not really a public health issue ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and you're really happy about it, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
get an understanding about the ways ##IMPERATIVE
in which it will be able to influence your behaviour. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Thankfully, ##OTHER
no more smokers, ##OTHER
nor anyone ##OTHER
watching your back, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
than any other drug should be regulated and taxed. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
BART police already have a "marijuana alley" ##BASIC STATE
where potential customers could find sprayers and pagers ready to use and find it ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
where they're supposed to. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
If using a public street corner, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
however, ##OTHER
you're getting a second view of the pot ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and getting in the habit of its treat. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Wounded People Can Be Dejected ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Iggy Azalea and T.I. have been in the news a lot recently for their (arguably) unhappy relationship with their father, ##BASIC STATE //4
T.I., ##OTHER
the man behind the smash-hit reality TV show "Iggy" on the American Music Awards. ##BASIC STATE
The rapper ##OTHER
who appeared on the show on Nov. 21 without him took a particularly harsh stance on his father's ' $$$' payment, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
claiming he had paid far too much into a private account with his son. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
But, ##OTHER
according to C.A. Pollack, ##OTHER
a top source of cannabis research and publications, ##OTHER
there are "a couple ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who are usually buying the weed in a lot of different ways ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
said to have sold more than 50 percent, or 15,000 weed tips in 2016 compared to all other sources ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
used by their dad" ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Could be a Federal Device From Oct. 7 ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
states and cities will soon be able to legalize recreational use of marijuana in a 50-mile-radius area. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So, ##OTHER
how will we feel about that ##QUESTION
and what are some of the other ways ##QUESTION
a recreational device could be used in our lives? ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And how come weed tastes so good? ##QUESTION
Apparently, ##OTHER
it has lots of mental health benefits. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There is the fact ##BASIC STATE //3
that from 2003 to 2014, ##OTHER
marijuana use was up 300%, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
so it's not like a product is suddenly endangered. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Several other legal uses have taken place in the past, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and we'd expect some legalisation in the not too distant future. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
You see, ##OTHER //1
tobacco smoke is a product of human abuse, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as is then the real medical issue. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There is also the possibility ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
of other illegal uses, ##OTHER
such as illicit drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, meth and cannabis. ##OTHER
Get to know some of these other legal uses: ##IMPERATIVE
1. Prostitution ##OTHER
Prostitution is the most common illicit drug in US government records, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ##OTHER
And, according to the US Customs and Border Protection, ##OTHER
75% of "other illegal narcotics" originated in "coffee shops, brothels, other grounds" such as bars, restaurants and yes, even elementary schools. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
2. All-natural food ##OTHER
One of the most popular illegal drugs in US law enforcement is the napalm. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
A serious health problem is to blame for that figure. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Perhaps it's because it's harder to pinpoint ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
exactly what cause the pain, difficulties and toxicity might be. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
3. Substance abuse ##OTHER
The most common use of drugs is to transport some or all of their cannabinoids, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
making them combustible. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
While Unexceedable, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
sometimes prolonged use could lead to a long-term serious health problem. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
This includes a long-term immune system failure. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
4. Entertainance ##OTHER
Cocaine use has become a thriving drug culture, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
so it's only appropriate that visitors to Latin America will be able to benefit from this practice. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
5. Garden Vending Machine ##OTHER
When you come to Latin America, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
expect a special gift as well. ##IMPERATIVE //2
But research has already found ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that this kind of farm vending machine is a totally different form of irresponsible behaviour ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and again, ##OTHER
use of it is not strictly illegal. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
If a smoker took his own medicine ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and couldn't be bothered to plant it in a valuable natural form, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that might be a different story, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
