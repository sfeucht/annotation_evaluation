When you and your buds get the munchies on April 20, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
the high holiday for marijuana users, ##OTHER
a small army of marketing professionals ##OTHER
is working to ensure ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that in your haze, ##OTHER
you'll reach for their brand of blazed, er, glazed doughnuts. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Or Totino's Pizza Rolls. ##OTHER
Or Burger King. ##OTHER
Or any other brand of junk food even from a wholesome, ##OTHER
family-friendly company that suspects ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
its biggest fans may be spending the day more flame-broiled than a Whopper. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
4/20, ##OTHER
as the holiday is known, ##BASIC STATE
is when brands ##BASIC STATE
want you to get baked (goods). ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
They want you to have a huge (ice cream) bowl or a (burrito) roll. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
In other words, ##OTHER
it's the day ##BASIC STATE
when corporate-sanctioned pot puns fly high on Twitter. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It's no surprise ##BASIC STATE
that Ben & Jerry's, ##OTHER
the tie-dyed Vermont ice cream maker ##OTHER
that has named ice creams "Half Baked" and "Phish Food" and "Dave Matthews Band Magic Brownies," would capitalize on the spirit of 4/20. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"Jerry and Ben started the company in 1978, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and they were definitely two hippies ##BASIC STATE
that were enjoying life, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
if you will," ##OTHER //1
said spokeswoman Lindsay Bumps. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Two years ago, ##OTHER
on 4/20, ##OTHER
the brand's scoop shops debuted the Brrr-ito, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
an ice-cream filled burrito ##OTHER
that definitely seems like a late-night stoner innovation. ##BASIC STATE
This year. ##OTHER
they're introducing another new menu item: ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The Chill-aco, ##OTHER
a waffle-cone taco with two scoops of ice cream and fudge drizzle, ##OTHER
"which gives it that ooey-gooey component," ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
Bumps said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"I think ##BASIC STATE
a lot of brands aim to stand out on that day." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The same goes for Lagunitas. ##BASIC STATE
The northern California brewery, ##OTHER
owned in part by Heineken, ##BASIC STATE
is bringing back its Waldos' Ale, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a beer ##OTHER
that Washington Post beer columnist Fritz Hahn called "the stickiest of the icky." ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The Waldos were a group of students ##BASIC STATE
who are said to have coined the term 420 in the 1970s ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and who worked with the brewery ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to develop the beer's dank flavor. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
It's "one of our best selling beers," ##BASIC STATE
said spokeswoman Karen Hamilton. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Alluding to marijuana in names for beer is "just something ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that we've always done, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
and it's not only on April 20." ##BASIC STATE
But it's not just companies from the liberal enclaves of California and Vermont ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who are partaking in 4/20 marketing campaigns. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
It's also big, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
mainstream brands, ##OTHER
such as Pepsi, Chipotle, Burger King and Denny's, ##OTHER
all of whom have alluded to 4/20 on social media in previous years. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
If you make food ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that's baked, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or comes in a bowl, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
well, ##OTHER
the ad copy writes itself. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Denny's tweeted its favorite, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
allegedly culinary words: ##OTHER
"Baked, cooked, fried, stewed, toasted." ##OTHER
Chipotle's photo of a burrito bowl came with the caption, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"Sometimes you need a huge bowl ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
to get you through the day." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Why are they so coy about it though? ##QUESTION
Even as more states legalize marijuana, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
acknowledging 4/20 can still be a tricky business move. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So brands ##OTHER
do it with a wink and a nudge for consumers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
who know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that "fried" doesn't exactly refer to chicken, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
but they stop just short of spelling it out in fear of pushing away their other customers. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Case in point: ##OTHER
Ask any one of these brands ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
what it is, ##QUESTION
exactly, ##OTHER
that people ##OTHER
are celebrating on 4/20, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and you'll make tricky work ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
for its spokesmen, ##OTHER
who have to acknowledge the "holiday," ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but don't want to cross a line for their corporation ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
by actually, ##OTHER
you know, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
acknowledging the holiday. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Which leads to clinically worded, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
coded emails like this one, ##OTHER
from Totino's Pizza Rolls spokesman Mike Siemienas: ##OTHER
"Totino's does some regional promotions ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
focused on current events in specific markets," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"We are running a similar campaign this year ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
by celebrating our fans ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
who love pizza rolls." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But pizza isn't the only thing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that's going to be rolling on Thursday right, Mike? ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Ever the professional, ##OTHER
he will not budge. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"This current event is relevant to our pizza roll fans in Colorado ##BASIC STATE
so that makes it important to us," ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Siemienas said in a subsequent email, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
studiously avoiding the words ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"marijuana" and "4/20." ##OTHER
It's pretty clear that the brand knows ##BASIC STATE
its audience isn't just time-strapped moms and hungry kids. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Some of the taglines ##OTHER
that Totino's will be using in its advertising this week ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
will include: ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
"Remember before you forget," ##IMPERATIVE
"It's high time for some Pizza Rolls," ##BASIC STATE
and the very Keanu Reeves-esque, ##OTHER
"It's pizza. ##BASIC STATE
In a roll. ##OTHER
Whoa." ##OTHER
They've also filmed a riff on "A Christmas Carol," except when Scrooge wakes up in the morning ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and looks out the window, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
astonished that he hasn't missed the big day 4/20, ##BASIC STATE
of course he inquires not about the prize turkey in the window, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
but about the availability of pizza rolls. ##OTHER
It ends with the hashtag #betterwhenbaked. ##BASIC STATE
Other brands practice flat-out denial. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
"We're really known for our tongue-in-cheek humor ##BASIC STATE
but it's pretty coincidental ##BASIC STATE
that it's coming out on the 20th," ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
said Bumps, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the Ben & Jerry's spokeswoman. ##OTHER
"That's the official line." ##BASIC STATE
But professionals in the cannabis industry don't love the pile-on from junk-food brands, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
which they say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
promotes negative stereotypes about the lifestyle. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Cannabis "is becoming a wellness product. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
We do not want people to believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that you just get munchies, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and you're just reaching for junk food. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It's part of a healthy lifestyle," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
said Olivia Mannix, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
chief executive of Cannabrand, ##OTHER
a marketing agency for cannabis companies. ##OTHER
The branding pile-on is also, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
for cannabis connoisseurs, ##OTHER
a sign ##OTHER
that their holiday is becoming as commercialized as Christmas or Valentine's Day. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"It's just another holiday for brands to jump on the bandwagon ##BASIC STATE
to market themselves," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
said Mannix, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and already, ##OTHER
the big brands' pot jokes are played-out cliches." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It's going to take a lot ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
to be clever. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
A lot of the things ##OTHER
have been said ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and done." ##OTHER
College kids might get a chuckle out of that burrito ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that looks like a joint, ##BASIC STATE
but cannabis consumers are more ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
than just the "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" crowd, ##OTHER
said J.J. Walker, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the founder of My420Tours, ##OTHER
a travel company ##OTHER
that's hosting World Cannabis Week in Colorado April 19 through 23. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"The bottom line is, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
this is a really good spending demographic" ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that encompasses "everything from your 21-year-old stoner, to CEOs, to your grandma," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Walker said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"Once these brands get over themselves ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
and realize ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
what cannabis can do, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
I think ##BASIC STATE
you're going to see a lot of brands coming on board." ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
In the meantime, ##OTHER
don't expect the digital marketing teams behind your favorite brands to be, well, blunt. ##IMPERATIVE
Bumps says ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that even though Ben & Jerry's has a good sense of humor on Twitter. ##BASIC STATE
they have to be careful not to go too far. ##BASIC STATE
"We try to get almost to that line, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
but we never really cross that line," ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Bumps said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Though she will acknowledge, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"Our numbers in store do quite well on that day." ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
