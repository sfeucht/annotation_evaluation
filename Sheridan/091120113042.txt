Domestic marijuana growers are harvesting a record $8.2 billion crop of homegrown pot this year, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
the National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has estimated. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The 1981 marijuana crop is twice as big as last year's, ##BASIC STATE
making the illegal herb the nation's fourth most valuable farm product, ##BASIC STATE
after corn, soybeans and wheat, ##OTHER
the pro-pot lobbying group claimed. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration called the $8 billion figure "far-fetched" ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
federal authorities recognize ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
domestic marijuana production is increasing. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
DEA estimated ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the 1979 U.S. pot crop was worth $1 billion to $1.5 billion ##BASIC STATE
and supplied ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
about 10 percent of the marijuana smoked in America that year. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
"We have no numbers for the 198l crop yet," ##BASIC STATE
said DEA press officer David Hoover. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"But based on the tonnage and the total market, ##OTHER //3
I don't see ##BASIC STATE
how the domestic marijuana market could be $8.2 billion." ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
George Farnham, ##OTHER
political director for NORML, ##OTHER
said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the organization's estimates are based on law enforcement statistics, newspaper accounts and figures ##BASIC STATE
supplied by growers. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Like law enforcement authorities, ##OTHER
NORML values marijuana ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
based on the price ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it would bring ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
if sold in small quantities, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Farnham said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Depending on quality, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
homegrown pot sells for $10 to $150 an ounce, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
he added. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Much of the marijuana ##OTHER
grown in the United States ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
is smoked by the grower or friends ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
rather than sold, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
so sales of domestic marijuana are smaller ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
than the $8 billion crop value indicated, ##BASIC STATE //3
he conceded. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
NORML estimates between 1 million and 2 million Americans grew pot for personal use this year, ##BASIC STATE //4
but only one-tenth that many grew it commercially. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Though several states have removed criminal penalties for possession of small quantities of marijuana, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
growing pot is illegal in every state except Alaska, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
which permits cultivation for personal consumption. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The total number of marijuana arrests last year was about the same as the year before ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
-- 342,000 -- ##OTHER
but arrests for cultivation and sale jumped more than 25 percent, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
from 49,700 to 63,300, ##OTHER
according to the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. ##BASIC STATE
Marijuana cultivation has spread all over the country from Hawaii and California, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and 29 states produced crops worth more than $100 million this year, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Farnham claimed. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
With a crop ##OTHER
valued at more than $1.5 billion, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
California is the leading marijuana producer, ##BASIC STATE
NORML says, ##BASIC STATE
followed by Hawaii at $750 million and Oregon at $400 million. ##BASIC STATE //3
NORML estimates ##BASIC STATE
Virginia grew $200 million worth of marijuana this year ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and Maryland produced another $100 million worth. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Virginia Beach police arrested 180 people one day last August ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
for growing pot around apartment complexes, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
NORML noted, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and Scott County authorities found a field with an estimated 15,000 marijuana plants. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Farnham said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the growth of domestic pot production has been encouraged by the Reagan administration's decision to cut the budget of DEA ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and curtail federal aid to local law enforcement authorities. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The administration recommended cutting the DEA budget 12 percent, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
from $228.5 million to $201 million for fiscal 1982. ##OTHER
The House and Senate versions of the DEA budget call for appropriations of about $231 million. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
NORML officials say ##BASIC STATE
the government's decision to spray the herbicide paraquat on Mexican marijuana fields ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
led to widespread cultivation of marijuana in the United States. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Rather than risk paraquat poisoning, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
potsmokers decided to grow their own, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Farnham explained. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Homegrown marijuana was once regarded as inferior to that ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
grown in Mexico, Colombia or Jamaica, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
but that's no longer the case. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Native American marijuana is a plant variety ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
called cannabis sativa, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
the same hemp plant ##OTHER
cultivated since colonial times for the fibers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
used to make rope. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Now growers are cultivating cannabis indica, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
a Far Eastern variety ##OTHER
that is richer in the intoxicating chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
While cannabis sativa is a skinny plant ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that can grow 15 feet tall, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the more potent indica strain grows like a bushy Christmas tree ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and can yield as much as two pounds of dried and ready-to-smoke marijuana. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
To make the smoke more potent, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
Farnham explained, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
growers have learned to weed out the male marijuana plants ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and cultivate a sterile, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
seedless female plant ##OTHER
known as sinsemilla, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
the Spanish word for seedless. ##OTHER
Unable to reproduce, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the frustrated female plants pour all their energy into producing THC resin. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It is this high-powered homegrown pot ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that sells for up to $150 an ounce, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
inflating the value of the domestic crop, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
NORML officials say. ##BASIC STATE
The organization says ##BASIC STATE
wild animals and poachers are greater threats to marijuana patches ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
than are law enforcement authorities. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
To avoid being caught with the crop in their yard, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
growers have taken to planting their patches on public land. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported earlier this year ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
it has found marijuana ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
being cultivated in most of the national forests. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
