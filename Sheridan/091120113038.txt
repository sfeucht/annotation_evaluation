With a week to go until Christmas, ##OTHER
we have picked up the pace nicely. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Our annual fund-raising campaign on behalf of Children's Hospital is homing in on $100,000, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a cheery sum indeed. ##OTHER
But around the paper-strewn slum ##OTHER
they call my office, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
we think of that 100 thou as the first of its kind. ##BASIC STATE
We are hoping for three more just like it, ##BASIC STATE
which would make the 1982-83 campaign the largest ever by a considerable margin. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
However, ##OTHER
we aren't going to be fruitful ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and multiply our "take" without help from you readers ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
-- lots of you, ##OTHER
as many of you as possible. ##OTHER
We hope ##BASIC STATE
that you'll take a moment ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
and send a check or money order today. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
As I have said, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
even $5 will help. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And you probably won't miss it. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
After all, ##OTHER
five bucks is about what a movie or a half-hour in a video games arcade costs these days. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
When you think of it that way, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
it doesn't sound like an awful lot. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Here are the totals ##BASIC STATE
as they stand this morning: ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
Grand total to date: $62,568.12. ##OTHER
Total ##OTHER
given this week: ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
$26,186.60. ##OTHER 
Individual donors to date: ##OTHER
1,280. ##OTHER
Group donors to date: ##OTHER
111. ##OTHER
For those of you ##OTHER
keeping score, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the grand total after three weeks of the 1981-82 campaign stood at $29,019.28, ##BASIC STATE
far less than what we have raised in the same period this year. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But this is no time for overconfidence, or resting on laurels. ##BASIC STATE
While the Christmas spirit is upon you, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
why not share a little of it with a sick child at Children's? ##QUESTION
You will make his holiday a little brighter in the process, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and you will help make possible the care and the research ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that will get him well, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and get him home, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
a little faster. ##OTHER
