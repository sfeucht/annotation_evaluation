That's interesting. ##BASIC STATE
Just to give you some (perhaps overly personal) background, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
about half the males in my family have a single psychotic episode around the time ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
they turn twenty with no clear environmental cause. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
When I had mine, ##BASIC STATE
despite knowing my family history ##BASIC STATE
and having a negative drug test for everything but marijuana, ##BASIC STATE
the psych hospital told my parents ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I had "almost definitely" smoked weed ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
laced with PCP, ##BASIC STATE //3
which was "the problem with dangerous street drugs". ##BASIC STATE
That's all just to say ##BASIC STATE
that I'm super-sensitive about saying ##BASIC STATE
someone caused their own mental health problems, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
because, ##OTHER
even from family members ##OTHER
who had experienced the same condition, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I had to listen to them ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
tell me ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4, bounded because timeframe mentioned in whole sentence
it was my fault for the months ##BASIC STATE
it took me to recover my normal patterns of thought. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
That article certainly makes more of a case ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
than I've seen elsewhere, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
but I'm not sure ##BASIC STATE
I find it convincing. ##BASIC STATE
Here's the paragraph ##BASIC STATE
where they differentiate correlation/causation: ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Of course, ##OTHER
association does not prove causation. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
However, ##OTHER
one by one, ##OTHER
alternative explanations have gradually been disproved. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
4 Patients do not start using cannabis ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
to self-medicate their psychotic or prodromal symptoms or side-effects of drugs, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
but rather use it for the same reasons as the rest of the population, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
principally for its ‘high’. ##OTHER
The risk of psychosis remains after controlling for personality disorder and use of other psychotogenic drugs. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Some overlap between genes ##OTHER
carrying susceptibility to schizophrenia and to drug use ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
has been reported but insufficient to explain more ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
than a fraction of the relationship. ##OTHER
4This argument seems to based on self-reported motivations, ##BASIC STATE
controlling for diagnosed personality disorders, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and controlling for other drug use. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I'm not sure ##BASIC STATE
the fact ##OTHER
that people express the desire to get high ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
says much about why they're taking a substance, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and I think ##BASIC STATE 
there's a much broader range of "sub-optimal" mental states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
(that might lead one to self-medicate) ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
than are regularly diagnosed. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
If they wanted to claim ##BASIC STATE //3
we knew ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
there was still a correlation after controlling for, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
e.g., ##OTHER
Borderline Personality Disorder ##OTHER
that'd be one thing, ##BASIC STATE //4
but it seems like a stretch to say ruling ##BASIC STATE //4
that sort of thing out proves causation. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
