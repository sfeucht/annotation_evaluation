Logically you're correct that, ##BASIC STATE
no, ##OTHER
there is no inherent contradiction between the two positions, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but what's notable about the two positions ##BASIC STATE
is that particular principles automatically fail ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
because they contradict at least one of the two positions. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
This is similar to the potential opposite view, ##BASIC STATE
being Pro Choice but also Anti Death Penalty. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
For the first one, ##OTHER
you can't hold the principle ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
"Killing another human being is only morally permissible in self defense", ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
because the Death Penalty is not an act of self defense. ##BASIC STATE //4
Similarly, ##OTHER
you can't hold the principle ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
if you're pro-choice and anti-death penalty ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as abortion is not an act of self defense. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
(You could get around this though by defining a fetus as not a human being, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but you do run into the issue of defining human being ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
more clearly) ##OTHER
For example, ##OTHER
if I gave you the political positions of ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"I am in favor of legalizing marijuana" ##BASIC STATE
and "I am in favor of increasing foreign aid", ##BASIC STATE
there isn't generally an issue. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Any principle ##OTHER
that would support legalizing marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
will not usually come into conflict with a position ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
regarding foreign aid. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
But with an issue like Pro-Life vs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Pro-Choice and regarding the death penalty. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
both involve issues of human life ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
directly being killed, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
so any principles ##OTHER
that support ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
one must not come into conflict with the other, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
or else you risk acting in contradiction to your own beliefs. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
They may not be contradictory, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
but they these ideas are in conflict ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
with which principles will allow both. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
