Americans who worship at the altar of marijuana had better not ##OTHER
look to the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
to keep them out of jail, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
suggests one recent case. ##BASIC STATE
That message was sent by the Florida Supreme Court to the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a Miami sect ##OTHER
that uses marijuana as an integral part of its worship service. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The U.S. Supreme Court has shown no inclination to send a different message ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
since it refused even to consider the issue. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Florida and U.S. officials have mounted a pincer attack against the Coptics. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
State authorities obtained an injunction against a church member ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
barring her ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
from using her home as a church, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
in violation of zoning regulations. ##OTHER
It also prhibits the use of marijuana there. ##BASIC STATE
vThe Florida Supreme Court upheld the injunction. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
The other half of the attack is being played out in a federal district court in Miami, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
where other church members are being prosecuted on charges of violating federal drug prohibitions. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The trials were scheduled to get under way this month, ##BASIC STATE
although legal maneuvering has caused postponement until at least February. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is not the first religious group in U.S. history to encounter difficulties ##BASIC STATE
in its attempts to find religious freedom. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Many of the early colonies, ##OTHER
though populated by settlers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
fleeing religious persecution in Europe, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
were not safe havens for groups ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who came with rites and rituals different than those ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
already established. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
In an attempt to end intolerance in the New World, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
the guarantee of freedom of religion received star billing in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
-- prohibiting Congress and later individual states as well, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
from interfering with the free exercise of religion. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
Nurtured by the protection of the First Amendment, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
various cults and religions sprang up. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Snake handlers, poison drinkers and mystics of all kinds flourished in some of the atypical sects. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The mix of drugs and religion is familiar to the region, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
dating back to ancient Indian rites. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The flower children of the '60s incorporated marijuana and hallucinogens into their forms of worship. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church comes closer to the Indian experience than to the religions ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that sprang up a decade or so ago. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
While the Constitution clearly allows legal authorities to prosecute persons ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
who claim religious beliefs solely as a cover ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
to engage in illegal activities, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
the constitutionality is not so apparent ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
where the illegal activity is an integral part of the worship service of a group ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that meets existing legal standards as a religion. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And while marijuana is an important part of the rite of the Coptic Church, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
its doctrine extends to other matters. ##BASIC STATE
Even the Florida Supreme Court found the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to be authentic religion as with regard to the First Amendment to the Constitution. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The Miami-based Coptic group claims links with the 6,000 year-old Coptic Church, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but its more recent origins can be traced to the Rastafarians of Marcus Garvey's movement ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
urging American blacks to look to Africa as a holy land. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Rastafarianism called itself after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie's name as a commoner. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //3
Selassie's crowning ##OTHER
as emperor was seen as the fulfillment of Garvey's prophecy to ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
"Look to Africa ##IMPERATIVE 
when a black king shall be crowned, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
for the day of deliverance is near." ##BASIC STATE
Restafarians established settlements in Jamaica ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
where believers lived together ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and convened to worship together. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
One of these missions became known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
whose doctrine feature is a process ##BASIC STATE
called "reasoning," ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
which involves a philosophical and theological dialogue ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
accompanied by the smoking of marijuana. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Marijuana is the sacrament of the church, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
replacing wine as the symbolic spirit of Christ. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Deemed the spiritual power ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
which unites men in one spirit, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
marijuana is smoked by church members three times a day, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
during morning, afternoon and evening worship services. ##OTHER
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church members contend ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that through marijuana or "ganja," ##OTHER
its Jamaican name, ##OTHER
man is able to look at God by looking within himself, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the embodiment of God on earth. ##OTHER
Attorney Milton M. Ferrell, Jr., ##OTHER
who represents the Coptics in their legal battles, ##BASIC STATE
contended in a telephone interview ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that church members adhere to such strict doctrines and dietary laws ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that others are hardly likely to adopt the Coptic's way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
of life ##OTHER
just to smoke marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Having qualified as a legitimate church, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
the Coptics cleared their first legal hurdle ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but there remained one indisputable point: ##BASIC STATE
Governmental interference ##OTHER
with religious practice is permissable ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
if the state can "demonstrate a compelling interest" ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
superceding the constitutional protection. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
To establish such a compelling interest, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
a state cannot offer just any reasonable justification. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It must be one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that is sufficient to overcome the strong policy in favor of not interfering with religious practices. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
For instance, ##OTHER
constitutional protection of the freedom of religion clause takes a back seat ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
when life is at stake ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or when a substantial health emergency threatens a community. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Ordering medical care for an endangered child ##OTHER
despite religious objections by the parents ##OTHER
is an example of this kind of compelling interest. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Other infringements ##OTHER
that have passed constitutional muster are the compulsion ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that an individual be vaccinated despite objections ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
based on religious handling of poisonous snakes. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The Florida Supreme Court found the legislature's determination ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that cannabis is a dangerous drug sufficiently compelling to negate the church members' constitutional rights. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This is not the type of strict scrutiny to which government attempts to regulate ##BASIC STATE
First Amendment rights are usually subjected, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
especially in light of the many medical experts ##OTHER
that the church had rounded up ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
to contest the finding of "dangerousness." ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The ill effects of marijuana remain a debatable issue. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
While states may freely ban its common use, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
interference with it in a religious context should require more convincing proof. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Florida courts undoubtedly were influenced against the church by the claim ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that the Coptics freely distributed marijuana to "children and adults, members and nonmembers." ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The Florida Supreme Court was thus able to distinguish the Coptics' claim from an earlier case ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
where the California Supreme Court prohibited the state from interfering with the use of peyote by adult Navajo Indians ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as part of their religion. ##OTHER
Attoney Farrell charged ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that the finding of casual distribution was based upon only one instance ##BASIC STATE
when a nonmember juvenile smoked marijuana at a church service, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a youth ##OTHER
who had gained entry ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
by lying to guards ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
posted by the Coptics, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
While most of us are unlikely to take the cause of the Coptics seriously, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
the guarantee of religious freedom is not reserved for those religions to which the majority of us subscribe. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In fact, ##OTHER
the real worth of any constitutional protection may be determined ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
by how well it guarantees the rights of people on the fringe. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
When the criminal trials begin in Miami, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
at stake will be the freedom of church members as well ##BASIC STATE
as the religious liberty of the Coptics. ##BASIC STATE 
tPerhaps ##OTHER
the possibility ##OTHER
of prison sentences ##OTHER
being meted out ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
will result in the application of the more serious First Amendment test to the Coptics' claim. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
