Alcoholic beverage sales fell by 15 percent ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
following the introduction of medical marijuana laws in a number of states, ##OTHER
according to a new working paper by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Georgia State University. ##BASIC STATE
The study adds to a growing body of evidence ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
showing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
that marijuana availability can reduce alcohol consumption. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Because experts generally agree ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
that, ##OTHER
on balance, ##OTHER
alcohol use is more harmful to individuals and society than marijuana use, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
this would represent a significant public health benefit of marijuana legalization. ##BASIC STATE
For the study, ##OTHER
researchers examined alcohol sales data ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
included in Nielsen's Retail Scanner database, ##BASIC STATE
which includes product-level sales data from 90 retail chains ##BASIC STATE
across the United States. ##OTHER
The researchers say ##BASIC STATE
this represents an improvement over other ways ##BASIC STATE
of measuring alcohol consumption ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
survey respondents, ##OTHER
for instance, ##OTHER
are known to severely lowball their alcohol consumption ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
when asked about it by interviewers. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The researchers compared alcohol sales between states ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that implemented medical marijuana laws ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
and those ##OTHER
that didn't, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
before and after the change in marijuana laws. ##OTHER
They also corrected for a number of economic and demographic variables ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
known to affect alcohol use, ##BASIC STATE
such as age, race and income. ##OTHER
We find ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that marijuana and alcohol are strong substitutes for each other, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
the study concludes. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
Counties ##OTHER
located in [medical marijuana] states reduced monthly alcohol sales by 15 percent after the introduction of medical marijuana laws. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
If these findings are correct, ##BASIC STATE
it's likely that they understate the effect ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
of full marijuana legalization on alcohol use. ##OTHER
Under medical marijuana laws, ##OTHER
only a small handful of people are legally able to access the drug patients wishing to use ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
it must typically obtain a recommendation from a doctor, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and in most states only certain conditions are eligible for treatment with marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Full recreational legalization, ##OTHER
as is the case now in Colorado and seven other states, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
means ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that any individual can purchase pot on demand. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
While not all of the existing research agrees ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
that marijuana availability decreases alcohol use, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
a solid body of evidence points to that conclusion. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
An analysis last year of 39 reports on the subject found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that 16 supported the idea ##BASIC STATE
that people substitute marijuana use for alcohol, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
while 10 studies suggested ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that ##OTHER
marijuana availability actually increased alcohol use. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Twelve additional studies supported neither conclusion. ##BASIC STATE
Unlike alcohol, ##OTHER
marijuana has no known fatal dose ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
people don't die of marijuana poisoning. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Relative to marijuana, ##OTHER
alcohol is more addictive, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
far more likely to cause vehicle accidents, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and much more closely linked to violent and aggressive behavior. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In the United States, ##OTHER
excessive alcohol use kills nearly 90,000 people each year, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ##BASIC STATE
