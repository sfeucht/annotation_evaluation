There are a lot of superlative claims about hemp oil: ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
most unsaturated oil, best essential fatty acids ##OTHER
(EFA) ratio and combination, highest amino acid variety, only plant source of vitamin D. ##OTHER
Can one oil be all that? ##QUESTION
In short, ##OTHER
yes. ##OTHER
Before we go further, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
let me address that unspoken question, ##IMPERATIVE //3
"Will hemp oil make me high?" ##QUESTION
No, ##OTHER
it won't. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Hemp oil is pressed from the seed of the hemp plant, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and this seed does not contain THC, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or tetrahydrocannabinol, ##OTHER
which is the psychoactive component of marijuana. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
However, ##OTHER
because of this concern, ##OTHER
many hemp oil suppliers provide transparent certifications ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
to assure buyers of the lack of THC content in their products. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Test Pledge is one such resource, ##BASIC STATE
wherein ##OTHER
"producers and processors of hemp oil ##OTHER
and hemp ##OTHER
nut must commission THC tests on each and every lot of hemp nut and oil, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
performed by a properly accredited laboratory ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
according to the official Health Canada protocol." ##BASIC STATE
In their assessment of hemp cosmetics on workplace drug testing, ##OTHER 
Petra Pless, ##OTHER
DEnv, ##OTHER
and Gero Leson, ##OTHER
D Env, ##OTHER
state, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"In case of the highly unlikely full-body application of pure hemp oil with a 10 ppm THC content on partially compromised skin THC ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
uptake could conceivably be raised to 11 g/day. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Even this higher rate is only a fraction of the 450 g / day of oral THC intake, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
found not to result in a positive screening test for marijuana." ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Don't judge hemp ##IMPERATIVE
because it may have a kooky cousin. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That's hardly fair. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Who doesn't have an offbeat family member or two? ##QUESTION
Why Hemp Hemp oil contains unsurpassed essential fatty acids ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
(EFAs). ##OTHER
As we are increasingly learning, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
there are good fats ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and there are bad fats. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
What makes a good fat good has much to do with these EFAs, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
specifically omega-3 and omega-6, ##OTHER
which are present in hemp oil in the perfect ratio of 1:3. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Plus, ##OTHER
hemp oil contains the anti-inflammatory gamma linoleic acid ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
(GLA) ##OTHER
as well as omega-9. ##OTHER
Its fatty acid profile is better than fish oil's, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
better than flaxseed oil's ##OTHER
-- it is the best. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Among many benefits, ##OTHER
these EFAs provide for more elastic skin and shiny, stronger hair. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Hemp oil contains a power-packed punch of additional nutrients, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
including calcium, potassium, magnesium, copper, vitamin A, vitamin B1 ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
(thiamin) , vitamin B3 ##OTHER
(niacin), vitamin B5, vitamin B9 ##OTHER
(folate), ##OTHER
and vitamin D ##OTHER
(of which it is the only plant source), ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
along with a useful dose of the antioxidant vitamin E ##OTHER
(tocopherols) ##OTHER
as well as all 10 amino acids for protein building. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Add to that list chlorophyll ##IMPERATIVE
(that's why it's green), ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
phytosterols, phospholipids, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, phosphorus, and a bit of iron and zinc. ##OTHER
Hemp oil is extremely non-comodogenic. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In other words, ##OTHER
it doesn't clog pores. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And ##OTHER
because its lipids mirror the lipids ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that our skin produces naturally, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
it works in sync with our body ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
to soothe and cleanse. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Healthy skin produces linoleic acid. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
If, ##OTHER
for whatever reason, ##OTHER
the skin can't produce linoleic acid, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
it alternatively produces oleic acid, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
a thick and sticky pore blocker. ##OTHER
Hemp oil contains the good linoleic acid. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Hemp oil is also a natural humectant, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
which means ##BASIC STATE
it draws moisture into the skin. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Instead of sitting on top of the skin the way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
less-effective oils do, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
it's able to penetrate the skin, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
moisturizing between cells ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and strengthening the cell matrix. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
It can get to hair roots, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
as well, ##OTHER
strengthening the scalp ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and reducing dry flaking or dandruff. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
It evens out skin tone ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and reduces blotchiness. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
How to Use It ##OTHER
Hemp oil is inexpensive ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
-- especially when you think of all the products ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
it replaces: ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
acne treatments, makeup to cover problem areas, moisturizers, and makeup removers, for instance. ##OTHER

as a butter replacement on toast, rice, potatoes, vegetables... ##OTHER
it's delicious! ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Keep in mind ##IMPERATIVE
that pure hemp seed oil cannot be used for high-heat cooking. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It has a low smoke point ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and will totally break down even at a moderate heat, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
at which point all nutritional benefits are lost. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Just remember, ##IMPERATIVE
pure hemp seed oil goes rancid easily. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
It needs to be kept in the fridge. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
However, ##OTHER
you can look for it as a shelf-stable ingredient in other personal care products. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
