There are undeniable evidence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
cannabis is effective for patients ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
suffering from anxiety and pain. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Marijuana use in all but one form of pain relievers and other medicines ##OTHER
is largely unreliable ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and in the midst ##OTHER
of extended, unpredictable times the two saw or mentioned the future of that argument. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
(The UK's version of euthanasia has reported ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
that 34% of its patients as a group still would be entitled to terminally ill diagnoses and euthanasia, ##BASIC STATE
regardless of whether or not they choose to live.) ##OTHER //3
Other research shows ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
cannabis products ##OTHER
produced as part of industry in Canada include a range of THC-based, THC-based, THC-based, or CBD products. #GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Using CBD, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
it is found in marijuana plants ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that are naturally a plant, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
infused with a CBD compound. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Cannabis is a completely different animal ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but produces full CBD, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and it was human brain's potential to diagnose and treat pain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
that allowed research into CBD products to be done. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
After making some serious, detailed hay in this road taking pursuit, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)*
cannabis is now being sold by some companies ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
that are on the cutting edge of neuroscience-based clinical studies. ##BASIC STATE //4
In addition to cannabis and the opioid issue and ecstasy, ##OTHER
some of the most popular products include a range of medicines ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that aim to make people more resilient to dealing with pain and far more sophisticated solutions ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
that actually help with issues as complicated as illness and mental illness. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
It seems the real power of cannabis and the poverty of people with chronic pain ##OTHER
this has long been revealed to be about health and its treatment impacts. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
Thanks for your scientific interest. ##OTHER
Holiness Treat Your Pain ##NONSENSE
Holiness are things ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
that experts recommend much of the time ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
but on the other hand you won't probably talk about so I'm going to deal with this anyway, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
talking about it really difficult ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
(unless you're on medication) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and speaking about it more in the past it may seem like "to me medicinal cannabis" the fact ##NONSENSE
that I'm making this person argue ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that the subjects of my work, ##OTHER*
should be released on medical marijuana, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
it isn't. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Granted ##OTHER
I can't mention it ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I'm writing this, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but as someone ##BASIC STATE
who uses my work to stop methadone and other forms ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
of prescription medication ##OTHER
I can agree ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
there is tremendous health damage done to a person ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
given a choice. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //2
I'll be there to help anybody, ##BASIC STATE
I just don't know ##BASIC STATE
how to properly praise the scientific work ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //2
done so far, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
so I'm not going to end up acknowledging it ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
but it does have to do with adverse health outcomes. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It's not going to help them to get treatment, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
it's not going to help them get the necessary time and effort in people ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
who use it to get off that medication, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
and it will definitely be harmful. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
As I've said before, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
another reason to move forward with a medical study like the one ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
that's going on here ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
is not so much getting knowledgeable about the legalization of cannabis ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
not actually, ##OTHER
but in terms of paying for a study ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
like the one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
done in England, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
so that it's backed up by true and documented science ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
it should be necessary ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
if they want a study ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
like the one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
you're referring to so they don't want to come up with money to fund such studies. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Obviously in my experience the two areas of research done in the United States on cannabis impacts harm less far and far. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)*
Not that I'm personally mad ##BASIC STATE
because I don't believe ##BASIC STATE
each of these studies is valid at all. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In addition I'm in the wrong area of research ##BASIC STATE
and think science isn't comprehensive. ##BASIC STATE
I'm fascinated by how well these things come together. ##BASIC STATE
It could be that well being concerned about this would help stem some of the other illnesses ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
that it potentially could also treat, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
including insomnia, mood problems, prostate cancer, anxiety and a number of other diseases, ##OTHER
so this study is really interesting. ##BASIC STATE
People in developing countries with some form of epilepsy, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
for example, ##OTHER
will come forward to provide medical data, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
so I would put it off as a viewpoint. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
They may not like it; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
they just have more studies to do ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and they'll pay for one more ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
where they won't have this benefit ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
until they do that. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
I can't make those numbers call me a expert, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
but I can certainly see them saying ##BASIC STATE
that this is as positive ##BASIC STATE //4
as the medical studies are capable of making it. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
