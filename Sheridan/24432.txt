I'm so sick ##BASIC STATE
of people saying ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
it's should be legal to smoke weed, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
weed is bad! ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it's not fucking healthy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
in anyway, ##OTHER
the research ##OTHER
that shows ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
it doesn't do much bad to you ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
is done on people well into adulthood, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and those people generally are not tested for very long, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and their brains are developed, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
so those research of course don't show many negative results ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
because weed does damage to your brain ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
that isn't as bad ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as when you use heroin ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
that fucks you badly up instantly, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
now on the other hand, ##OTHER
research on young people is the one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that is showing the bad results, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that are true i.e possibility ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
of hindering or disrupting cognitive function and plenty of other bad stuff, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
basically if you're an adult ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it doesn't do that much bad to you ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but still can do bad stuff to you, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
it's very dangerous to young kid's brains and their development. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Look weed should be allowed for dying cancer patient and other people ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
who feel ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
awful and just want to enjoy their last living moments peacefully, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but how can you possibly justify legalizing weed ##QUESTION
when it has already shown ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that it does horrible damage to young peoples brains ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and i'm not talking about teens, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
peoples brains aren't fully developed until 25! ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
and has bad effects on adults too? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And to those ##OTHER
who use alcohol death rates as a comparison, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that doesn't make any fucking sense either!? ##BASIC STATE //4
alcohol is literal poison, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it kills far more yes ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
but that's because the effects of marijuana do not show as prominent as alcohol ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //2
but it still does damage to your body ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and why try to justify that with the rates of poison ##QUESTION
that's only legal because of it's history ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and it's just common in todays culture. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I know ##BASIC STATE 
this was all over the place, ##BASIC STATE
but what I'm trying to get ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
across is that weed is bad for you ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and statistics don't tell you the whole story ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
because of the age range ##OTHER
those researches ##OTHER
are made on, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but I sure ##OTHER
as hell wouldn't want my future kids to be in a world ##BASIC STATE
where weed is easily reachable, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but of course ##OTHER
terminally ill people should have the chance to enjoy their last few living moments happy. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
