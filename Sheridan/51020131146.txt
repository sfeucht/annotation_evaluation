So reading the first quarter of so of Scalia's piece and the blog, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
it seems their (the majority's) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
main rationale hinges on that they believe ##BASIC STATE*
that California's marijuana market ##OTHER
(in this case) interferes with federal regulations of interstate commerce ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
(illegal drug trade). ##OTHER
The question to me is whether this interference is really substantial enough ##BASIC STATE
to warrant such a potential expansion of powers of the Commerce Clause. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I think ##BASIC STATE
the reality is that creating a legal medical marijuana market * does * have an impact on the marijuana supply in other states as well. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It creates a legal market for a previously illegal good within California. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
However, ##OTHER
this good is easily transferable to out of state ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
(it's not like marijuana expires; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
and if a medical marijuana license was as easy to obtain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as it is today, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
then the restrictions wouldn't prevent out of staters from getting a license). ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
As such, ##OTHER
to me it seems understandable at face value ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that SCOTUS would be concerned about an over extension of a state's ability to impact out of state markets through such a legalization. ##BASIC STATE
Furthermore, ##OTHER
since the time of the ruling, ##OTHER
what qualifies as interstate commerce has only become more complicated with the advances in technology ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
which have taken place ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
which make it even easier to order goods from out of state. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Does the ruling ##QUESTION
open a potential pandora's box of extending federal government power over the commerce clause? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The way ##OTHER
that the majority opinions seem to state it, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it doesn't necessarily. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
They leave it rather vague, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and seem to only validate such a ruling ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
for a case ##OTHER
dealing with specific markets such as illegal substances. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
