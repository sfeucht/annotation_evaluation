BBC watch Manu Paigana talk about the case. ##IMPERATIVE
Nevermind the fact ##IMPERATIVE
it's another offence that, ##BASIC STATE
while legal, ##BASIC STATE
still means you can't be transported to heaven. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
You are caught in a central location, ##BASIC STATE //3
falling from one side of a sheer wall. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
They only say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that you are on special privileges ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
because you're such a damn thing, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but someone else apparently does not have the same privilege ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
when it comes to this matter. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
To be perfectly honest the situation at hand is rather great. ##BASIC STATE
I've done plenty of treatment, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
taken drugs, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I've gotten pretty high in all seriousness. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
You can write a useful article to you from a pharmacy, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but then I feel ##BASIC STATE
like I'm a bargain now. ##BASIC STATE
The problem is, ##BASIC STATE
I don't feel like offering over the counter advice and guidance even remotely worth the effort. ##BASIC STATE*
It sounds like the media must be partially to blame. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
At the very least, ##OTHER
we don't need a police force ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that will always point out ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and probably waffle about what happened ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but still waiting for all the proper rules. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)*
My husband is unhappy ##BASIC STATE
he should be having sex ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
while his husband is still with him ##BASIC STATE
but continues having sex ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
when his wife is still with him. ##BASIC STATE
While that would be annoying to both women, ##BASIC STATE //4
I think ##BASIC STATE
it might be beneficial for you both. ##BASIC STATE
Fuckingly, ##OTHER
it really wouldn't be sexually enjoyable. ##BASIC STATE
Also, the answer to the question ##OTHER
" WHICH YOU SHOULD CHANGE TO?" ##QUESTION
needs to be answered with some filter ##BASIC STATE //4
before it can start leaking out. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
If you do choose to talk about how you could better serve the country ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
you love ##BASIC STATE
and get married ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
when you are still an adult, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
by all means ##OTHER
do it, ##IMPERATIVE
but accept ##IMPERATIVE
that it may not be a good thing for you ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or for the country at large. ##OTHER
If you can give a reasonable answer, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
don't go back in time. ##IMPERATIVE
Get the message. ##IMPERATIVE
Be able to give a reasonable answer ##IMPERATIVE*
just because you know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
it's actually a good idea in the first place. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And if it's a good idea then it's a bad idea. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
I think ##BASIC STATE
I know better than you. ##BASIC STATE
I have written to many people on this matter, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
including some politicians. ##OTHER //3
I have seen ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
just how easy the process is for a politician to start climbing the mountain without knowing it. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Their argument usually depends on their credibility, their skills, or their habit, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
but only if you are a kindly old old liberal ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that you take seriously ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)* //3
your duty to help the country ##OTHER
you love. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And by that I mean ##BASIC STATE
that honesty happens to everyone. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
Everyone is on the other side of it, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and if one person's opinion is not trusted enough to admit ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
they are wrong. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
My family and I are on the other side of this ##BASIC STATE
because we live with the addiction, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as in, ##OTHER
in our privacy. ##OTHER
We try to stay off booze and drugs at this point. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
In my opinion, ##OTHER
the only reason ##OTHER
more people should do this ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
is that the addiction to these drugs like drug play are exactly the same as abuse, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
except instead of drunkenness and drugs are "going down" the wrong road, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
alcohol is helping the addict ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and addicts are far more honest and less trusting. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Definitely make sure ##IMPERATIVE
you drink no more than five or six ounces of alcohol a night. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //1
Never strip naked ##IMPERATIVE
before your spouse leaves you ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
and that ##OTHER*
before you walk away. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
Having a baby is not a crime, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
even though, ##OTHER
uh, ##OTHER
I have been accused of it already ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and I told you ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
how well I should have known it ##BASIC STATE* //2
when I was pregnant. ##BASIC STATE
Yeah, ##OTHER
a few times. ##OTHER
So, ##OTHER
who knows ##QUESTION
how long I'll keep doing this, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
anyway. ##OTHER
Keep it simple ##IMPERATIVE
and let the social side of things do the talking. ##IMPERATIVE*
If you're wondering ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
why the social point of ##QUESTION* //1
"don't strip naked ##IMPERATIVE
before your spouse gets ready for baby", ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //2
I don't know why. ##BASIC STATE
What I do know is, ##BASIC STATE
you probably don't want to be naked during the winter ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
unless you could control your husband, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and you need that protection. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Whatever you want to do with your possessions, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
people have been devious in getting you to do that. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
