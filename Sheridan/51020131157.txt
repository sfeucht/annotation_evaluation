The problem as I see it ##BASIC STATE 
is that some drugs do constitute a danger to society in and of themselves. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Methamphetamine can cause you to completely lose your mind. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
You will act in ways ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that you never would sober, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and a nonviolent person can become violent as a result. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
I'm speaking from my own personal experience. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I used to be a meth addict ##BASIC STATE
and I became totally different from the person ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I was before over a period of less than six months. ##BASIC STATE
I never had a problem with money ##BASIC STATE
and I was always able to buy it without any problem. ##BASIC STATE 
But I became paranoid and dangerous. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I became almost exceedingly violent ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and would go off at the drop of a hat. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I once threw someone over my second story balcony ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
because they said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"fuck" ##OTHER
after I told them ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
not to. ##OTHER
I don't remember ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
why I told them not too, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and I'm not sure ##BASIC STATE
it mattered. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
At the time I had absolutely no compunction about doing it, ##BASIC STATE
and I was totally unconcerned about whether or not the fall would hurt ##BASIC STATE
or kill them. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Luckily the guy was fine other than some scrapes and bruises, ##BASIC STATE
but to be perfectly honest ##BASIC STATE //3
it wouldn't have mattered ##BASIC STATE 
if I had been living on the 5th or 10th floor. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Since I have cleaned up ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I have never been violent with anyone ##BASIC STATE
or been in any trouble of any kind, ##BASIC STATE
and it's been more than 17 years. ##BASIC STATE
Some drugs turn some otherwise normal people into monsters. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
At the very least those drugs should be illegal. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Smoke all the pot ##IMPERATIVE
you want, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but there are some drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that should not be in widespread use. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There will always be gangs and shitty people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
doing shitty things to make money, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and I'll agree ##BASIC STATE
that some drugs should be legalized and regulated in order to take that revenue source away from the black market ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and to keep people from being needlessly imprisoned, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
but by no means ##OTHER
should it be all of them. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Some drugs really do create crime in and of themselves. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
