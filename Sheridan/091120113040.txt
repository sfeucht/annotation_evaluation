In Italy, ##OTHER
as in most of western Europe, ##OTHER
medical cannabis is legal. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
What sets the country apart is that cultivation of the plant is a de facto army monopoly. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The only place ##OTHER
cannabis can be legally grown here ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
is at a heavily guarded military facility in Florence ##BASIC STATE
where, ##OTHER
this year, ##OTHER
two greenhouses produced a yield of about 220 pounds. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"We do everything in-house," ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
said the facility's director, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Col. Antonio Medica. ##OTHER
"We grow the plants, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
harvest them, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
dry and grind the leaves, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
sanitize the final product with gamma rays, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
then ship it to pharmacies and hospitals." ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Now the army's involvement in the therapeutic marijuana business is set to expand. ##BASIC STATE
Under a new budget law ##OTHER
moving through Parliament, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the cannabis program at the Military Chemical Pharmaceutical Plant is to receive an additional $2 billion in public funding. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
If the bill ##OTHER
is approved ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
as anticipated, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
military officials say, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
they expect production to triple within a year. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The bill will also make medical cannabis free for all patients, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
with the cost ##OTHER
covered by the government. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Until now, ##OTHER
local governments have covered the cost in just 11 of Italy's 21 provinces. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Not everyone is happy with the army's role, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
however. ##OTHER
Some say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
they believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that even with the new funding, ##OTHER
the quantity and the quality of Italian-grown cannabis will fall short. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
To understand ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
how the army ##OTHER
ended up growing pot, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
one has to understand the country's health policy and the way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
its implementation has, ##OTHER
at times, ##OTHER
been delegated to the military. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Italy legalized cannabis for medical use in 2007, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
with many caveats. ##OTHER
To grow the plant legally requires special authorization from the Health Ministry's narcotics office, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
which means dealing with the country's infamous bureaucracy. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
As a result, ##OTHER
no private entrepreneur managed to set up a business, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and the drug had to be imported from abroad, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
making it prohibitively expensive. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Ten new greenhouses for cannabis cultivation, ##OTHER
pictured above in May, ##BASIC STATE
are to be added to the two ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
currently used at the armys Florence facility. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The plant hopes to triple its production of medical cannabis to meet the demand of Italian patients ##BASIC STATE
and to end the need to import from abroad. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //2
Since access to medical care here is considered a constitutional right, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
in 2014 the government assigned the task ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
of growing medical-grade cannabis to the military. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The army was already responsible for the production of "orphan drugs," ##BASIC STATE
medications ##OTHER
that cure rare diseases ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and are not produced in the market economy. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
"Producing medicines is a standard part of what the Defense Industries Agency does, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
because health is a matter of national security," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Medica said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Problems with the decision soon became apparent, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
according to critics. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
One difficulty is that the army ##BASIC STATE
makes only one strain of cannabis, ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
called FM2, ##BASIC STATE //4
which is low in THC, ##BASIC STATE //4
one of marijuana's main active substances, ##OTHER
when compared to imported strains. ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
Andrea Trisciuglio, ##OTHER
a 39-year-old multiple sclerosis patient from Foggia in southern Italy, ##OTHER
said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
he has been using medical marijuana for the past 10 years ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
to mitigate his symptoms ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
but has found the local supply ineffective. ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"The FM2 just doesn't work for patients like me," ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"I have to use Bedrocan" ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
a variety of cannabis with about 22 percent THC, ##OTHER
compared to FM2's 8 percent. ##OTHER //2
Trisciuglio said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that his local hospital imports Bedrocan from the Netherlands ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
but that he sometimes he has to wait as long as a month for it. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
The trouble with importing cannabis from the Netherlands is that it "is expensive, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //3
which also makes it slow," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
said Carlo Valente, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a lawyer in the southern city of Lecce ##OTHER
who is representing Trisciuglio and other patients. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Dutch medicines, ##OTHER
he said, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
reach Italy through intermediary agencies, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
which raises their price. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
"This is making doctors, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
who already struggle with the social taboo ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
associated with cannabis, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
even more reluctant to prescribe it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
and hospital pharmacies less cooperative," ##OTHER
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
According to an investigation by the magazine Internazionale, ##BASIC STATE
imported cannabis can cost up to $84 a gram. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
By contrast, the army-produced cannabis costs $7 a gram, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Medica said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"We are a nonprofit." ##BASIC STATE
The medical-grade cannabis ##OTHER
produced by the Italian army is the strain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
known as FM2, ##BASIC STATE
which ##OTHER
some patients ##OTHER
say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
is not as effective as imported varieties. ##BASIC STATE
But to critics of the system, ##OTHER
affordability does not cancel out the homegrown product's other shortcomings. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
In addition to quality issues, ##OTHER
they say, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
the army ##OTHER
lacks the capability to produce all the therapeutic cannabis ##BASIC STATE
that Italy needs. ##BASIC STATE
National consumption of the drug is between 880 and 1,000 pounds a year, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
according to military estimates. ##BASIC STATE
This means ##BASIC STATE
that even if the military succeeds in tripling its annual production to the anticipated 660 pounds, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
it will not meet the country's need, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and imports from the Netherlands will still be necessary. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
To Trisciuglio, ##OTHER
the army monopoly ##OTHER
is not in patients' best interest. ##BASIC STATE
"The army alone is just not enough," ##BASIC STATE
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"We need to make it easier ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
for others to grow medical cannabis." ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
In 2012, ##OTHER
Trisciuglio and other patients petitioned the local government for authorization to grow their own marijuana, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
under supervision, ##OTHER
but never received a green light. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Medica, ##OTHER
however, ##OTHER
is confident ##BASIC STATE
that the army ##OTHER
can meet ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and keep up with the demand, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
perhaps even to the point of sending its own cannabis abroad. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
"We are working around the clock ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
to increase the production ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and are experimenting with a new variant, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
for patients ##OTHER
who are not satisfied with FM2," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
he said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"In the near future, ##OTHER
we hope to export to San Marino and the Vatican." ##BASIC STATE
