Beauty and wellness products ##OTHER

but they have different effects. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
CBD is touted as having therapeutic and stress-relieving benefits, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
while THC is responsible for the high ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
associated with marijuana use. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Additionally, ##OTHER
CBD is legal in many states, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
while THC is not. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You can find cannabis products for a relaxing bath, for soothing sore muscles and for healing chapped lips. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Theyve even a found fan in Olivia Wilde, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
who raved about a topical CBD lotion by Lord Jones in a 2017 New York Times profile. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
And celebrity stylist Karla Welch has said ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
she tells her clients ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

Dr. Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology told XXX ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that while the enthusiasm for cannabinoids in skincare is definitely growing, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the science behind cannabis and cannabinoids for skin health is still sparse. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
A lot of the research focuses on the cannabinoids usefulness in relieving itchiness ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
associated with dry skin and eczema. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Cannabinoids also have some anti-inflammatory effects, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
as well as potential anti-tumor effects, ##OTHER
Jaber said, ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
though he added ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that much more research remains to be done. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Unfortunately, ##OTHER
most of the studies on the cannabinoids have been done in the laboratory only ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and there are very few studies on people, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Jaber said. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
So additional well-controlled, clinical studies need to be done to see ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
how effective these ingredients actually are in real life. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Another issue with cannabinoids in skincare products is that its difficult to know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
exactly what youre getting, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

Since it is not regulated its difficult to know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)

to support beneficial effects on the skin. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
My aim is to be research-focused in health care. ##BASIC STATE
Anyone can make claims, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but I want to see ##BASIC STATE
what studies have shown, ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and as it relates to cannabis, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
there is just not a lot of support yet. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It may come in several years, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
but until then, ##OTHER
I think ##BASIC STATE
a lot of it is hype, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
she added. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I do not think ##BASIC STATE
it is harmful, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I am just not sure ##BASIC STATE
it helps. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
As a result of the varying state laws ##OTHER
regarding marijuana, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
much of these products are mainly available in states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
where marijuana is legal (like California and Colorado) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and they often arent available online. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
