That doesn't answer anything ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
the poster said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
It offers an evidenced theory as to why cannabis has a medical effect on the human body ##BASIC STATE 
and isn't simply an excuse to get stoned. ##BASIC STATE
See the answer to the third question below. ##IMPERATIVE
The endocannabinoid system processes chemicals ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
secreted by the human body. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It functions ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
and is useful even in somebody ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
who doesn't use cannabis at all. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Exactly. ##OTHER
Medicine is used ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
because something is wrong ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and a symptom needs to be addressed. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Claiming that the existence of chemicals in nature ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //4
that our body can process does not mean our bodies developed in symbiosis with those chemicals. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Which is why theories are explored ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
and supported or discarded. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Plant cannabinoids interact with humans in specific ways within the endocannabinoid system. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
So the symbiosis is simply an established fact. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This symbiosis has known medical applications. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Humans are just another mammal on a space rock ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who happened to have evolved an endocannabinoid system ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
to regulate certain mammal body functions. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Humans can also process external plant-derived cannabinoids to known therapeutic effects. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
On this human-inhabited space rock grows ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
a cannabinoid plant ##OTHER
which may be one of the first human domesticated plants ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
stretching back into our unknown prehistory. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
I may be using the term "evolve" a little loosely, ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
but the connection between the plant, the mammal and these specific chemicals ##OTHER
occurred on a small space rock over a long period of time. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
You're making the same mistake ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
as those Intelligent Design folks. ##OTHER
No need to be snarky, ##OTHER
but you do raise a hilarious point. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
If one is to assume a cosmic watchmaker, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
then she designed da weed for a reason. ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Christians should be the biggest pot heads. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
God made grass after all. ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Or is that the infamous tree of the knowledge of good & evil ##QUESTION
that pisses god off so much? ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
