This comes from an academic paper on how states can cover up to how many deaths they prevent from being caused by violations of state and federal laws ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)* //3 
A prestigious research paper claims ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
there's a simple rule of thumb ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
when it comes to definition of human existence for a given life: ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
that the human being is within the bounds of marriage. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And really thats the problem. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
A 2013 study ##OTHER
prepared for the U.K. agency ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
that commissioned the paper Legacy of Lifelong Freedom ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
says that the code of discernment and justification behind the violation of marriage laws ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
is so simple ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that its reasonable to choose the position ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
between the arguments ##OTHER
made by many people and the positions of advocates on the other side. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Keep in mind the decades of anti-homosexual legislation ##IMPERATIVE
the country has been pursuing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
and the entire world has been shocked by how quickly the government took on this topic ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and began to put a strain on relationships, ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
especially in the U.K. in particular. ##OTHER
There is now a sizeable restriction for the taking of gay men in some areas, a ban on a certain amount of consensual gay sex in family affairs, a commission in Europe and a bill in the European Parliament of moving same-sex marriage by legislation. ##BASIC STATE* //4
The UK has gained a reputation ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
for being more open about their treatment of gay and lesbian people. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This helps in respect to the fact ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that more people in the UK are on discrimination cover, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
not homosexuals themselves. ##OTHER
In order to cover up such misconduct ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
by authorities ##OTHER
the legal justification will have to be delivered as yet another reason ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that they will be doing so. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Read our previous columns about this work: ##IMPERATIVE
How to follow the definition: ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //2
How to circumvent the delayed point, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //2
like in the U.S., ##OTHER
whereby it is necessary to get through an administrative agency for doing the crossing. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
This policy is designed to circumvent the customary protocol of using the states laws as a guide ##BASIC STATE
and to straighten out the enforcement plans. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The smaller the discretion of the state, ##OTHER*
the faster the violation will come out. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It is a lawful state law. ##BASIC STATE
And it is often seen as a barrier to enforcement. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The mantra of these state statutes is stay on. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
This is common sense and all too common sense. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)* //3
At least 10 times in the U.K. for example, ##OTHER
one minister had a ban on kissing against parliament ##BASIC STATE* 
in order to help support financial support for gay couples. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The most likely security balance: ##OTHER
would there be armed guards for the invasion of the frontier or would it be in England or Wales ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
where Christians are a minority? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
If there were those armed guards ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
there could be no indigenous killing or rapes. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And, ##OTHER
in cases of them ##OTHER
being used by cults, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that is not good enough. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Alarming breakdown: ##OTHER
if you do get attacked in your neighbourhood ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and you are asked to be a natural test for someone on the same terms as me by the law, ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //4
its likely ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that you will have been attacked and its likely ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that you will be insulted ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and then isolated. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It is as if you are the only one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
who has to endure such a crisis. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Your intuition is critical: ##BASIC STATE
If the person says something, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
he needs to be reminded ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
that the person is already engaged in criminal activity ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
like a prison, ##OTHER
not a doctor. ##OTHER
This is a reason to keep reminding yourself. ##BASIC STATE 
Noise: ##OTHER
If you are listening, ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
its important to keep asking yourself ##BASIC STATE 
how many people we listen to when we look into what is going on. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
And, more importantly, get a clear indication ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
that this information ##OTHER
you say may not be accurate. ##BASIC STATE 
But if someone wants to listen to you, ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
its better to act on it in a manner ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
that is informed and convincing. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
