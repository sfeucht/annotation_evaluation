In 2014 , ##OTHER 

the year of legalization , ##OTHER

 and not one . ##OTHER

Agribusiness , ##OTHER 

the third sector of the economy - ##OTHER

 which includes everything from wood products to carpenters - ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 was the biggest winner of the legalization period . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

It sparked a new wave of artisanal craft startups all over the world , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 as it means ##OTHER 

 that practically no one else had anything ##PERFECT COERCED STATE

Now , ##OTHER 

a new batch of companies is ready to go along with some of the deals : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 small businesses ##OTHER 

 born out of desperation ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 have the right ##PERFECT COERCED STATE

 to try to cash in on the drug , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 just like anywhere else : ##OTHER 

 as small businesses compete to maintain the integrity of the land , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 particularly before the six-month testing period expired . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

amid the shifting political landscape of the US and why he has traditionally been a star performer . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

There 's a small circle of entrepreneurs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 which is not easily integrated into most businesses , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

It is good and evil to take the side of those  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 who harm others from a vaccine induced problem ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 Talking drug of choice for the wrong cause ##NONSENSE 

 I learnt ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)  

 it is good to take the side of those ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 who harm others from a vaccine induced problem .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Unfortunately , ##OTHER 

I did n't believe ##BASIC STATE 

 people ##OTHER 

 who experimented on my child today ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 would do it again ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 or the harm ##OTHER 

 I had caused them ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 has been detected . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

I did educate people on medicinal use of marijuana , methamphetamine , and peri-psilocybin . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

MY first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions ##BASIC STATE 

 but on the other hand I missed the beneficial effects of the drug for such a long time .##BASIC STATE 

My friend Marie from London told me ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 the migraines were just as serious ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and I asked her why .##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

Yet I did n't take any information out of the children ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 who were so ignorant on medicinal uses of cannabis , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and wrote down the positive things ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 that she had learned from her research about medicinal use of cannabis , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 even if this information came directly from others .##BASIC STATE 

The simple truth is that someone ##BASIC STATE 

 who has an addictive drug will generally do well once they get it with the other ingredients . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

And ##OTHER 

 without a prescription , ##OTHER 

 they would n't be overdoing it . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

For any adults , ##OTHER 

their parents or friends , ##OTHER  

 who do a lot of drugs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 many are probably too ignorant to understand ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 what is wrong with them and the drugs ##QUESTION 

 to do nothing about it .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

However , ##OTHER 

 in these days of drug addiction  ##OTHER 

 it is best to avoid alcohol , painkillers , pain relievers and psychedelics such as tequila , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 the latter more toxic than marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and drugs ##OTHER 

 known as terpenes ##OTHER 

 tend to lead to powerful and long lasting reactions in a manner ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

 that is at odds with what is available in the marketplace .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

Things go wrong with these drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 when cannabis is both unregulated and unregulated in a way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 we rarely hear about because they are illegal .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

It has the potential ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 to create a brain , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2

 which was destroyed by psychotic lovers ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 who drank and smoked it for months on end .##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Before many people have their worst experience of cannabis in their parents ##PERFECT COERCED STATE 

Kate 51020131143.txt typo:  PERFECT COERCED STATE
 they should have their best chance ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)

 of buying it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and making more of it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to stop the drug from developing in the first place . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

As much as there are people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 who go on drugs ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 they become addictive ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and make you feel great , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 they start to have negative feelings . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE

Being in school or driving around in the morning ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 or while going to school , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 does not have an addictive effect ##PERFECT COERCED STATE

Kate 51020131143.txt typo:  PERFECT COERCED STATE
 that will ruin your child 's life or their studies . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

I felt glad ##BASIC STATE

 I never took an overdose because of the pain ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 and brought more happiness to myself and my family . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

As I have written before , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 it is important that anyone ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

 who has ever done drugs of choice ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 take steps ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 to reduce his or her risks of opioid dependence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  

 by monitoring their cell phone activity ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and taking random medication .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

That includes talking to experts  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to find out ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 what risks are present in your loved one , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and getting advice from doctors ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to prescribe less harmful medications . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

The biggest problem ##OTHER 

 with these drugs is that they have no stimulant ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and can take a long time ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 to free up energy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 and increase protein production .##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

We treat alcohol consumption as a part of a normal life ; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 heroin users are not drug users , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 alcohol use is not a problem , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

 and there are no known adverse side effects from legal methods such as smoking cigarettes . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

A good education is necessary ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 before you get in the habit of engaging in regular drugs of choice such as heroin and other painkillers . ##BASIC STATE 

For people ##OTHER 

 who do use opiates like Xanax and Molly , or opium , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 heroin is safer than legal street drugs such as Oxycontin and Vicodin ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and will help heal chronic pain and anger management . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

One of the best educational articles ##OTHER 

 I wrote in 2014 about these activities ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 was Rosalind Denton 's Curious Citizenship , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 which talked about personal experiences for kids ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 who are addicted to substances .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

My first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions ##BASIC STATE 

 and was an educational exercise .##BASIC STATE 

As the pain grew , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 I realized ##BASIC STATE 

 how many other people around me had similar experiences . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE 

Kate 51020131143.txt typo:  PERFECT COERCED STATE
Having witnessed it firsthand ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 I realised ##BASIC STATE 

 that it is hard not to get sick , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 especially with the regular dose of opioids . ##OTHER 

Right now , ##OTHER

the US Navy ##OTHER

 ( USN ) ##OTHER

 is helping authorities down the coast of Greenland ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 to clear 4,300 tonnes of coal ash from rivers in one of Europe 's harshest environmental impacts . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

Britain has also signed an international deal ##BASIC STATE 

 to cut its own carbon emissions .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

If we ca n't act to reduce global warming , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 European countries have no choice ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 but to adopt a tougher definition of climate change .##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

It 's like children ##OTHER

 jumping out of a mow .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

But in truth , ##OTHER 

the answer is not to persuade the UK ##BASIC STATE 

 to take action on the issue ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 ( I 'm sure ##BASIC STATE 

 the PM has the skills ##BASIC STATE 

 to do that by himself ) .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)  

Only to persuade their leaders ##OTHER

 to allow us to think ##OTHER

 they can answer the climate change question ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

 if they simply want to stop being hypocrites themselves .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

If they ca n't , ##GNERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 their efforts ##OTHER 

 to convince others to do likewise are well-deserved . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

When you get personal with their choice of words , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 I sometimes get in a bit of a draw .##BASIC STATE 

GETTY Their public rejection of climate change means ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 they wo n't have the freedom ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to fight dirty tactics ##OTHER 

 when they want to .##OTHER

The reason is simple .##BASIC STATE 

In the post-WWII era , ##BASIC STATE 

 humans are responsible for over 30 % of the earth 's heating and about 7.6 % of the heat ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 the planet 's surface generates .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

When people in factories shut their doors ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and factories moved to newer locations such as Asia or Switzerland , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 people suddenly became scared of human beings .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

On one level , ##OTHER

 this is a scary thing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 because the fundamental assumption seems to be that humans account for about 40 % of carbon emissions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 which would clearly be absurd ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 if the government had not threatened to attack European companies ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 if they attacked us ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 or threatened to threaten other nations . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

But ##OTHER 

 when you get personal with their choice of words , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 I sometimes get in a bit of a draw .##BASIC STATE 

Although the public were rather appalled and horrified by Britain 's decision  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to cut our carbon emissions from power stations at its very heart , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 the government is not really paying the price for the nonsense .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

At heart , ##OTHER 

 the government is insisting ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 that it have to deal with climate change in the way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 other countries are after oil and gas companies are after gas . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

British coal polluters pollute climate with fossil fuels , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 so may they blame us ? ##QUESTION 

PRICE DISSECTED : ##OTHER 

 The UK currently has the highest average global oil prices at $40 per barrel , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 compared to countries ##OTHER 

 with cheaper gas or other sources ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

As fossil fuels are threatened , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 the country ##OTHER 

 being considered in the latest emission reduction scenarios is certainly by now being considered among the most sensitive in the world right now . ##NONSENSE

The scientists ##OTHER

 who report the latest carbon emissions numbers are not wild prediction folks .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

They give no reason  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 for such a massive search .##OTHER 

Meanwhile , ##OTHER 

 if we look at the number of countries ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 that do take action , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 they are a distant second to Paris and Russia among the nations concerned , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 only behind the UK .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

But those countries say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 they will not increase their emissions ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 unless they are on their own , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 I suspect , ##BASIC STATE 

 having found ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 that some countries have anti-active or anti-pollution policies . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

If the international community is going to ignore the threat ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 posed by climate change , ##OTHER 

 it wo n't just be people in the United States , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

or almost everyone else , ##OTHER 

 or any of the rest of the developed world . ##OTHER 

We should , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  

sooner or later , ##OTHER 

 start meeting the political and technical commitments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  

 we need to make . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)  

If we take action , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 we 'll have to justify ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 why we should be following this lead .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

This week Ill be taking you to a long but not overt speech of religious significance . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

I want to bring you closer to the time ##BASIC STATE 

 when those ##OTHER 

 who enjoy liquor as punishment and pardon ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 use it as peace and order ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to begin some long holiday celebrations .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

No-one can beat the booze ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and some of those ##OTHER 

 celebrating these rituals in their sleep have a strong social bias against alcohol . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Instead , ##OTHER 

they elect to drink more in reaction to changing circumstances and in their mind , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 which makes them a lot less tolerant , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 in some cases ##OTHER 

 as you probably know . ##BASIC STATE 

Few parties survive to the end , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 and its even harder to make friends with your friends of your own intellectual or visual persuasion . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

Seasoned young people go to party spots now ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 that make up less than 10 % of the population .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

That is not how I see it .##BASIC STATE 

Sooner or later that will change ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 

 as it has in both maths and a lot of scholarly literature and scholarly culture and times  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE

Kate 51020131156.txt typo:  PERFECT COERCED STATE
 we are already living in . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

At the very least , ##OTHER 

 there may be a need for a private and public place as soon as possible ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 

 to share these experiences . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Yet still others are forced to pick up just too little oxygen in the night sometimes so much ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

 what good ##QUESTION 

 you can accomplish . ##BASIC STATE 

This might be for the great causes , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 but with a bit of awareness ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 one could even take the seed of the ideas of those ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 I abhor the old things in various ways .##BASIC STATE 

There are fun texts about the social values of alcohol and pot .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

There are men and women ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 rethinking the ways ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 of alcohol and drugs ##OTHER 

 taping our minds about the road ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 of shame . ##OTHER 

In many of these conversations ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 there is the light at the end of the tunnel and an aspiration for change . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

But there are far more exciting ways ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to involve ourselves as Homo sapiens in our growing and much more exciting lives ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

than alcohol and drugs in the narrow circle of politics , dialogue and anthropology . ##OTHER 

Back at the bus stop . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

People ask me ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 where we are from , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 but I think ##BASIC STATE 

 we are from a few places . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Back in the Day of the Indian and Chinese Diaspora . ##OTHER 

Back in 1967 when the Indian wars were all but over , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 Indian Gen. Myron Joseph Benben talked to me about his stint in Pakistan .##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

I think ##BASIC STATE 

 he was like that for all of the students in his generation . ##BASIC STATE 

He met a woman from Tibet . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

I know both of those kids for a fact . ##BASIC STATE

It was at that time ##BASIC STATE 

 that a wave of Indian immigrants to the US first sailed on the Potomac ##BOUNDED EVENT (STATIC)

 and took over our town . ##BOUNDED EVENT (STATIC)

the person ##other 

 who keeps a mental resume with an acre of rice ##BASIC STATE

 that allow them to ride on the boat and through the mud . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

All this while you kept putting you into interviews , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 or even running short stories on the end ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 these deep and intimate conversations reveal in the writing  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 what you think of the world as a marriage of love and the hopes of its parents , ##BASIC STATE 

 that have eaten the less fortunate into oblivion , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 that you and your family are destined for the very real threat of more wasted lives , ##BASIC STATE 

 less well fed and more demoralised and unemployed .##BASIC STATE

When California 's Mendicino County publishes it annual farm production census this spring ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 agricultural Commissioner Ted Erickson will dutifully report  ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 that wine grapes are the county 's No. 1 crop . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

That 's not true ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 and Eriksen knows it . ##BASIC STATE 

But the Mendicino Board of Supervisors and California state officials have ordered him not to report on the county 's most lucrative farm crop  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 -- marijuana . ##OTHER 

Marijuana growing is a $100-million-a-year business in Mendicino ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 Eriksen estimates ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 so big ##OTHER 

 it makes the county 's $20 million worth of grapes look like small potatoes . ##BASIC STATE 

After years of ignoring illegal marijuana farming , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Eriksen finally included the crop in his annual report last year . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

He might as well have lit a joint in the courthouse . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

There was such a flap  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

 that Eriksen had to tear the marijuana page out of every issue of his annual report  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 and promise never to report on pot again . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

" A lot of people feel  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Mendocino is one of 17 northern California counties  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 in which Marijuana farming has reached such a scale  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 that federal agents have been sent in to try and stop it . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

Until recently the marijuana business was dominated by imports ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 primarily from Columbia . ##OTHER

But ##OTHER 

 while U.S. steel and automakers are pleading for protection from imports  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and the nation 's producers of shoes and television sets are struggling to survive against foreign competition ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 the domestic pot industry is proving  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 it can beat the imports . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

American Marijuana growers harvested a record crop last year ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

well over 1,000 metric tons of the illegal herb ,  ##OTHER 

 federal authorities and private marijuana specialists estimate . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

Federal Drug Enforcement Administration statistics released a few days ago  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 show U.S. marijuana production growing at a rate  ##BASIC STATE 

 of better than 20 percent a year , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 while marijuana imports are up only about 13 percent . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

The agency estimates ##BASIC STATE 

 Americans smoked  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 marijuana worth between $15.5 billion and $21.9 billion in 1979.Perhaps $2 billion to $3 billion worth was grown in the United States . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

 U.S. tobacco production was worth $17 billion that year . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

Once considered a youthful indulgence , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 marijuana has gained increasing acceptance among adults ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 the DEA said . ##BASIC STATE 

Use of the drug by youths 12 to 17 is " leveling off " the agency reported ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

The rapid growth of marijuana cultivation has for the first time forced the DEA to switch some of its law enforcement effort  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 from trying to stop smuggling  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and to concentrating on catching domestic producers . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Commercial marijuana growing began in the United States only about five years ago ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and already homegrown pot accounts for an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent of the 14,000 to 15,000 tons  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Measured in dollars ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 the domestic pot growers have captured an even bigger share of the market ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

As if they had taken a percentage lesson from Madison Avenue ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 U.S. marijuana farmers are cashing in by concentrating on the luxury market ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 what even the DEA admits  ##BASIC STATE 

 if the best marijuana available  ##OTHER

Domestic growers have used designer genitics  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 to produce pot many times more potent than garden-variety grass . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

They 've even given it  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 what amounts to a brand name  ##BASIC STATE 

 -- " sinsemilla . " ##OTHER 

The word is an amalgam of the two Spanish words  ##BASIC STATE 

 meaning " seedless "  ##BASIC STATE 

 but has come to imply champagne-quality homegrown marijuana . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

U.S. growers are getting $100 to to $200 an ounce for their sinsemilla , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 while Columbian grass sells for $40 or less . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

And  ##OTHER 

 because the channels of distribution are much shorter for American marijuana  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 -- much of it is sold directly by the growers --  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 the domestic producers are making far greater profit . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

On an investment of $3,000 or less ,  ##OTHE R

California and Hawaii are the leading marijuana growing states ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 reports the DEA . ##BASIC STATE 

" We 're not saying ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 it 's just Claifornia and Hawaii ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 " stressed Schickedanz . ##BASIC STATE 

" You 'll find it in every state  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 that has a growing season long enough for vegetables . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

Anybody  ##OTHER 

 who can grow a tomato  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 can grow marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

When the DEA began cracking down in northern California , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 growers moved over the border into Oregon . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

Arkansas is rapidly building a reputation ##BASIC STATE 

 as California 's rival , ##OTHER 

 say officials of the national Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws  ##BASIC STATE 

 ( NORML ) . ##OTHER 

They contend  ##BASIC STATE 

 marijuana is grown in every state and the District of Columbia , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 where much of it is cultivated indoors . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

Campaigning for the right ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to grow grass for personal consumption  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 is the latest move for the group , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 which until now has stressed efforts  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to ease or erase criminal penalties for possession of small amounts . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Only Alaska now permits people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to grow their own grass , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 said George Farnham , ##BASIC STATE 

the young lawyer  ##OTHER

 who serves as a political director of NORMAL . ##BASIC STATE 

In most states , ##OTHER 

growing marijuana is a far more serious crime than getting caught with an ounce or less . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

Many state laws treat cultivation of even a single marijuana plant with the same severity as selling drugs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

 imposing mandatory prison sentences . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

Farnhan says U.S. grass growers " benefit the U.S. economy ##BASIC STATE 

 by keeping the money in the country  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 instead of giving it to Columbia . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

It helps our balance of payments . " ##BASIC STATE

Buying marijuana from a " hippie farmer in Arkansas " is better than getting it from a multinational smuggling ring ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

 he argues . ##BASIC STATE 

Government efforts  ##OTHER 

 to halt foreign marijuana production and smuggling ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

especially the spraying of the poison paraquat on marijuana fields , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

 lead pot smokers to start growing their own , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 the NORML lawyer suggested . ##BASIC STATE 

Fear of paraquat and the Mexican government 's success in curtailing marijuana cultivation ##OTHER

 have cut imports of the Mexican variety ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 sharply ,  ##OTHER 

 the DEA says . ##BASIC STATE 

From 2,200 tons in 1978 ,  ##OTHER 

Mexico 's supply to the U.S. fell to at most 1,500 tons in 1979 . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

Imports of Jamaican " ganga " doubled ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

however , ##OTHER 

 as troubles in the economy of that island nation lead more Jamaicans  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 to turn to growing and smuggling . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

Colombia remains the main supplier ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 exporting an estimated 10,100 tons of marijuana to the United States in 1979 . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

Smuggling has grown to such an organized level  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 that twice in 1979 U.S. drug agents intercepted shipments of 50 tons of marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

 -- an entire shipload . ##OTHER 

Marijuana weed , ##OTHER 

 also known as the hemp plant ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 was cultivated for rope in midwestern states during World War II  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and still grows wild in much of the country . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

But marijuana smokers learned long ago  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 that wild weeds do n't have the desired impact . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

The plants are very low  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 in cannabis resin and in tetrahydrocannabinol  ##OTHER 

 ( Thc ) , the ingredient  ##OTHER 

 that makes users " high . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2

" People used to look down their noses at homegrown , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 " Farnham says ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 " but now when you 're talking homegrown ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 you 're talking about the best marijuana in the world . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

American marijuana is considered more desirable ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 he explained ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 because growers have learned ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 how to increase the THC content  ##OTHER

 and grow a crop many times more potent than the imported variety . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)

The most potent California marijuana contains as much as 6 percent pure THC ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 agreed DEA agent Schickedanz ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 while ordinary grass has as little as 0.05 percent of the psychoactive chemical . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

To make their stuff stronger ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 pot farmers plant a different variety . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

The marijuana  ##OTHER 

 grown in Mexico , Colombia and Jamaica and the wild weed in the United States is a plant  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 called cannabis satavia . ##BASIC STATE 

Another variety grows in Asia ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 cannabis indicia ,  ##OTHER 

 containing much more resin . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

Americans in Vietnam developed a taste for the Eastern variety ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and brought the seeds home with them . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

But the secret of sinsemilla is in the growing . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

The cultivators emasculate their marijuana patches , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 culling out the male plants as soon  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 as their sex can be determined . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Struggling futiley  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 to reproduce without males ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 the frustrated females pour all their energy into producing THC ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 because the sticky chemical helps trap pollen . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

The result is a monster marijuana plant  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 -- 10 to 20 feet tall ,  ##OTHER 

 vivid green ,  ##OTHER 

 bushy as a Christmas tree ##OTHER  

 and literally dripping with THC . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

DEA officials estimate  ##BASIC STATE 

 that each sinsemilla plant will yield an average of a pound of pot , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 and some will produce two or even three pounds . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

Both DEA and NORML representatives agree ##BASIC STATE 

 that $1,000 a pound is the going price for sinsemilla in that quantity. ##BASIC STATE 

The smoker ##OTHER 

 who buys ##OTHER 

 an ounce will probably pay $100 to $200 for it , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 pushing the value of a pound to $2,000 or $3,000 . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

Government drug officials in the past have been accused of inflating the value of drugs ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 to exaggerate their danger . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

But DEA estimates of sinsemilla output  ##BASIC STATE 

 are based on the one-pound-to-the-plant ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

$1,000-a-pound rule ,  ##OTHER 

 and NORML officials say  ##BASIC STATE 

 the government numbers are ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

if anything , ##OTHER 

on the low side . ##OTHER 

But the pro - and antimarijuana forces disagree on other aspects of marijuana growing . ##BASIC STATE 

The people  ##OTHER 

 who want to legalize pot describe a cottage industry right out of " The Greening of America " with friendly folks  ##BASIC STATE  

 who , ##OTHER 

 as Farnham puts it , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 " grow a little grass for themselves and their friends . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

DEA talks of marijuana millionaires , pot plantations and staggering profits . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

A single sensimilla plant will yield 1,500 hand-rolled joints of marijuana too potent for most smokers to consume by themselves . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

" One plant is enough  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 to keep somebody stoned out of their mind for a year , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 " said Schickedanz . ##BASIC STATE 

Each plant requires a plot about three feet in diameter , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 so a moderate-sized garden will produce 100 plants  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

 yielding $100,000 worth of sinsemilla ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 

 the DEA agent noted . ##BASIC STATE 

The biggest grower  ##OTHER 

 busted by the DEA in its California raids had 7,200 plants , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

worth at least $7 million . ##OTHER 

With a crop that valuable ,  ##OTHER 

 the growers do n't just throw their seeds in the ground  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and wait for the harvest ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 Schickendanz said . ##BASIC STATE 

About this time of year  ##OTHER 

 they start the seeds in individual planting pots ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 just like tomatoes or cabbages . ##OTHER 

In the spring ,  ##OTHER 

the seedlings are transplanted outside . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

( Urban growers often produce pot in a closet ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  

 using fancy lighting systems  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)  

 that produce the wavelengths  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 

 the plants prefer . ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2

Deer , rabbits and other garden pests love the leafy marijuana plants ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 

 so most of the serious growers fence their plots with chicken wire or woven wire fencing . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

To keep out burrowing creatures ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2

 they extend the wire underground ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 and to keep out poachers ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2

 more than a few plots have burglar alarms . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 

Schickedanz said  ##BASIC STATE 

 one of the California growers  ##OTHER 

 his group caught last year had installed two above-ground swimming pools ##NONSENSE 

 to hold water and liquid fertilizer for his marijuana garden . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 

" He 'd hooked up a couple of pumps . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

All  ##OTHER 

 he had to do was step out of his cabin  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 and hit a switch ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

the first pump would run  ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

 until the plants got their water ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

 then shut off automatically . ##OTHER

Then a second pump would give them the fertilizer . " ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 

The DEA agent estimates ##BASIC STATE 

 " Operation Sinsemilla " wiped out 20 percent to 40 percent of the marijuana crop in northern California last year . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 

But ,  ##OTHER  

 he admitted reluctantly ,  ##BASIC STATE 

 " I personally do n't think  ##BASIC STATE 

 we 'll ever stop it . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 

New high in support for legalizing marijuana  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Fully 50 percent of Americans say  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
