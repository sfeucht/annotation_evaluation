Some porn is ok , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but there ’ s some abuse porn , stretching , fisting , spitting , peeing , pooping , etc . ##BASIC STATE 
Remember the 2 girls 1 cup . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
Would you want a 16 yr old masturbating to that thinking ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)//3 
 it ’ s normal ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
This is where my last line in the actual bit of the argument ##BASIC STATE 
 comes in about parents making sure ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 their child is safe and informed .##BASIC STATE 
I agree ##BASIC STATE 
 there are genres of porn ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that you can stumble upon that promote unsafe ideas ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 i.e. abuse , rape , etc. ##OTHER 
 but generally you need to include those sorts of things as search terms ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 in order to actually find them . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Children should be taught ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 this sort of thing is wrong ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and that consent and a condom are the golden two for any encounter ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they may have in the future . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
I also believe ##BASIC STATE 
 children are smart enough ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to realise things ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 like 2 girls 1 cup are n't exactly the norm . ##BASIC STATE 
There are always going to be ways ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 for pre adults to view pornography , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 whether there is a law ##BASIC STATE 
 in place ##OTHER
 or not. ##OTHER 
Which is why instead of stigmatising it  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 and discouraging conversation , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 we should promote safe and secure ways ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 people can use pornography . ##BASIC STATE 
In the UK , ##OTHER 
marijuana is an illegal drug ##BASIC STATE 
 to distribute despite it being relatively safe ##BASIC STATE 
 compared to many other drugs ##OTHER 
 ( including alcohol and tobacco ) .##OTHER 
However , ##OTHER 
 classifying it as similar to cocaine or meth ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 has restricted the conversation on it ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and causes people to become misinformed about the effects of the drug ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and stigmatises those ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who use / sell it .##OTHER
Despite the law , ##OTHER 
 people will still consume marijauna . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
However , ##OTHER 
the law has caused misinformation ##BASIC STATE 
 regarding it 's consumption ##OTHER 
 which has lead to worse circumstances than the act itself . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
