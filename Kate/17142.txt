I 'm sorry but your post seems very .. ##BASIC STATE 
Inaccurate I guess . ##OTHER 
Barely anybody wants ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 it legalized for the sole purpose of being a cure . ##OTHER //2 
Yes , ##OTHER 
it is one of the reasons ##BASIC STATE 
 that people want it legal , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but you ca n't say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2 
 people ##OTHER
 who want it legal are short minded .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
There are other reasons to legalization , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 such as how it is fairly safe .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Better than alcohol , ##OTHER 
 and that is legal . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Also , ##OTHER 
we are wasting tax dollars and labour for the imprisonment of people ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 who were using marijuana . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Do you think ##QUESTION 
 it is right to ruin a person 's life ##QUESTION
 because of smoking a plant ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that makes them happy ? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
We can also generate a lot of money for us ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 if it is sold in stores and taxed. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
Also , ##OTHER 
 one of the reasons ##BASIC STATE 
 why tobacco was assumed safe is ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 because we didn't have all the technology to analyze it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that we do today .##OTHER 
When we got this tech , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 we realized ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that it was bad .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Now with pot , ##OTHER
 we have analyzed it ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and it is shown ##BASIC STATE 
 that it is not so bad . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
TL ; DR ##OTHER
 being a cure is not the only reason ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2 
 people want ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 it legalized , ##OTHER
 saying ##OTHER 
 that people ##OTHER 
 who want it legal are short minded is in-factual ##BASIC STATE
