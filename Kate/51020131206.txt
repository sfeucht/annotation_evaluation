This is not a reality ##BASIC STATE
 nor is it a fiction , ##BASIC STATE 
 it is in the eternal struggle of Americans . ##BASIC STATE 
There was the election of Trump , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 there was the rise of Trumpism , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 there was the marginalization of conservatives in the senate , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and there was a conservative minority in Congress . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
The victorious Trump was the elected embodiment of this strange dichotomy , ##BASIC STATE 
here in America , ##OTHER 
 we have some large , small , liberal states ##PERFECT COERCED STATE
 using anti-bureaucratic muscle and their unrealistic , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
empty dreams of national power and greater government .##OTHER 
On paper we have all the answers , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE 
but then not in what is a complex and complicated system of governance , the bureaucracy , the political structures , democracy , and the partisanship 
 that governs politics , legislatures , and oversight . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Politicians , ##OTHER 
they should have been established many years ago with different virtues , different values , different ideologies , ##COERCED STATER (GENERIC) 
 varying set of parameters and assumptions and language ##other 
 and they started out with one goal : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to screw , demagogue , ruin , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and overthrow the working class . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
The one goal of the non-trivialized Communist Party , ##OTHER 
the baddy who conspired with communists ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to orchestrate the downfall of the United States and then the Communist League , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC). 
 is the overthrow of the corrupt and corrupt elites , governments , power centers , civil liberties and basic security . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
So the first political experiment in modern American society is the systematic overthrow of the system of local government and the marginalization of powerful control over the product and liberties on all levels , ##BASIC STATE 
 including the public goods , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 including the services . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
Here is how you make it happen : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 elected officials are controlled by local communities , legislatures , governors mansions , and senatorial representatives .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
The federal government is therefore subordinate to local governments and the local control of their official interests . ##BASIC STATE 
On the surface we know all the centralized control in our society , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but our model still requires redistribution , redistribution of wealth , redistribution of revenues , and redistribution of opportunity . ##BASIC STATE
Take love thy neighbor as an example : ##UNBOUNDED EVENT 
 new universal health care system must be passed , ##BASIC STATE 
 constitutional amendments ##OTHER 
 requiring all individuals to have insurance ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 are written and adopted to discourage the practice ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of syphoning down benefits . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
These want to give in to the public demands of people desperate to see ##NONSENSE //3  
 if they can get a shot at a new life , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because they cant afford the basic basic necessities ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that it was not for them . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
On the surface , ##OTHER 
yes but if you cut back the government power ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
 you will end up diminishing the aggregate power of one unelected small group of people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who purport to be democrats . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The reach of this system , ##OTHER
this world of government , ##OTHER
is deeply fragmented and often ludicrous , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
a little like a small non-civilized family ##OTHER
 looking at the dynamic of various political factions , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 drawing the outline of a less organized family . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
We need thoughtful monitoring ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of how the political norms can be more and more diverse , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 also changing the model of governance , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (STATIC)
 even recognizing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (STATIC)
 that while one unitary system will have no actual power , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 the definition of separate and unable states may differ based on member number , demographic characteristics , hierarchy and interests . ##BASIC STATE 
We need a federation of states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which coordinates our society . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (STATIC)
There are state governments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that are both conglomerates and supra-royal and quite the cool polytechnic kind of group . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are state and state-specific elections and a constitution  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that reflects their individual communities and international alliances . #COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
You will find too many such councils to really have a role in making a well-rounded state , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 but there are two possibilities ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that may emerge , ##OTHER
one being pragmatic states like Utah and Vermont ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that start out producing the goods ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that everyone needs , ##OTHER
 that also have direct influence over the results of local races . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE 
Each one , ##OTHER
however , ##OTHER
should be mindful of the differences among its population groups , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and that also allows state-level branches of politics . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
I could go on and on ##BASIC STATE 
but my preference is to conserve as much power as possible , ##BASIC STATE 
 limit the right of anyone on any level of government ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to control every aspect of our society ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to subsidize the legislators of our elected representatives , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to set the terms of basic liberty in a sound and rational way , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to ensure ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that the state never has too much influence on everything but the economic interests of the state , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to not default to the status quo , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 or to independence .##OTHER
