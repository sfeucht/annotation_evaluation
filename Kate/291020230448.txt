Adult Coloradans consume roughly 121 metric tons of marijuana a year , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 according to a new Colorado Department of Revenue study ##BASIC STATE 
 that estimates demand at 31 percent more than a recent projection ##BASIC STATE
 and virtually double some outside estimates . ##BASIC STATE
The study ,  ##OTHER  
 released this week , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 sought to ascertain how often and how much pot is consumed by the states adult residents and visitors . ##BASIC STATE
What they found ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 was that there are 485,000 regular adult users of marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 a group ##OTHER 
 that accounts ##BASIC STATE 
 for roughly 9 percent of the states forecast 2014 population . ##OTHER 
Toss in adult residents ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 who have used the drug in the past year and estimates of those under 21 years old ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 who have used in the past year ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and that share rises to more than 15 percent of the population . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
The study is unique in that , ##BASIC STATE 
 according to the authors , ##BASIC STATE 
its the first to look at both demand and supply  ##BASIC STATE
Measuring supply is convenient ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because sales data is recorded , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but it leaves out the significant role of black market , home-grown and imported marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Measuring demand gives a better sense of how much of the drug is in use . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
While the amount of underground and illegal production ##OTHER
 is expected to decline significantly , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 some level is believed to exist to date , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the authors write. ##BASIC STATE 
Therefore , ##OTHER 
 in order to determine the total market for licensed and unlicensed marijuana , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 a demand approach is more practical . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
To measure demand , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 the researchers first estimated the number of users and then the amount ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 consumed by each over a given period of time . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
But that just gives an estimate of how often people are using , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 not how much . ##OTHER 
To measure demand , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 they relied on surveys . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
And because there are myriad ways to consume pot ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 each with varying potency , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they measured by dried flower weight . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Heres a tour ##BASIC STATE
 of some of the reports conclusions  ##OTHER
 about marijuana use in Colorado , ##OTHER 
seven months ##OTHER
 after legal sales began there : ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 About 9 percent of adults are projected to use marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 at least once a month ##OTHER
The state predicts  ##BASIC STATE 
 that 485,000 adults consume the drug at least once a month , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) 
 translating to about 9 percent of the forecast population for the year . ##BASIC STATE 
Another 201,000 reported using it in the past year , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 roughly 3.8 percent of the population. ##OTHER
And  while the report focuses on adult use , ##BASIC STATE 
 the report did mention an estimated 184,000 residents under 21 years old ##BASIC STATE
 who have used the drug within the past year . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Frequency of pot use is concentrated at the extremes ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Adult residents either smoke pot ( relatively ) ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 few times a month or ##OTHER
 nearly every day there are few in the middle . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
More than half of all adult resident users consume the drug in some form fewer than six times a month . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) 
( More than 1 in 4 consume less than once a month . ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) 
At the same time , ##OTHER 
 about 1 in 5 users are near or at daily consumption . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Frequent users consume the vast majority of marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) 
 While those roughly daily users account for just a fifth of the user population , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they consume fully two thirds of the product . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
