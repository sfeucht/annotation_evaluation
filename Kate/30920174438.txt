Right now , ##OTHER
the US Navy ##OTHER
 ( USN ) ##OTHER
 is helping authorities down the coast of Greenland ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 to clear 4,300 tonnes of coal ash from rivers in one of Europe 's harshest environmental impacts . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Britain has also signed an international deal ##BASIC STATE 
 to cut its own carbon emissions .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
If we ca n't act to reduce global warming , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 European countries have no choice ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but to adopt a tougher definition of climate change .##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
It 's like children ##OTHER
 jumping out of a mow .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But in truth , ##OTHER 
the answer is not to persuade the UK ##BASIC STATE 
 to take action on the issue ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 ( I 'm sure ##BASIC STATE 
 the PM has the skills ##BASIC STATE 
 to do that by himself ) .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)  
Only to persuade their leaders ##OTHER
 to allow us to think ##OTHER
 they can answer the climate change question ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 if they simply want to stop being hypocrites themselves .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
If they ca n't , ##GNERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 their efforts ##OTHER 
 to convince others to do likewise are well-deserved . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
When you get personal with their choice of words , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 I sometimes get in a bit of a draw .##BASIC STATE 
GETTY Their public rejection of climate change means ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they wo n't have the freedom ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to fight dirty tactics ##OTHER 
 when they want to .##OTHER
The reason is simple .##BASIC STATE 
In the post-WWII era , ##BASIC STATE 
 humans are responsible for over 30 % of the earth 's heating and about 7.6 % of the heat ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the planet 's surface generates .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
When people in factories shut their doors ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and factories moved to newer locations such as Asia or Switzerland , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 people suddenly became scared of human beings .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
On one level , ##OTHER
 this is a scary thing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 because the fundamental assumption seems to be that humans account for about 40 % of carbon emissions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which would clearly be absurd ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 if the government had not threatened to attack European companies ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 if they attacked us ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 or threatened to threaten other nations . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But ##OTHER 
 when you get personal with their choice of words , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 I sometimes get in a bit of a draw .##BASIC STATE 
Although the public were rather appalled and horrified by Britain 's decision  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to cut our carbon emissions from power stations at its very heart , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 the government is not really paying the price for the nonsense .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
At heart , ##OTHER 
 the government is insisting ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that it have to deal with climate change in the way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 other countries are after oil and gas companies are after gas . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
British coal polluters pollute climate with fossil fuels , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 so may they blame us ? ##QUESTION 
PRICE DISSECTED : ##OTHER 
 The UK currently has the highest average global oil prices at $40 per barrel , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 compared to countries ##OTHER 
 with cheaper gas or other sources ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
As fossil fuels are threatened , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the country ##OTHER 
 being considered in the latest emission reduction scenarios is certainly by now being considered among the most sensitive in the world right now . ##NONSENSE
The scientists ##OTHER
 who report the latest carbon emissions numbers are not wild prediction folks .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
They give no reason  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 for such a massive search .##OTHER 
Meanwhile , ##OTHER 
 if we look at the number of countries ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that do take action , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 they are a distant second to Paris and Russia among the nations concerned , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 only behind the UK .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
But those countries say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 they will not increase their emissions ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 unless they are on their own , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 I suspect , ##BASIC STATE 
 having found ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that some countries have anti-active or anti-pollution policies . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
If the international community is going to ignore the threat ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 posed by climate change , ##OTHER 
 it wo n't just be people in the United States , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
or almost everyone else , ##OTHER 
 or any of the rest of the developed world . ##OTHER 
We should , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  
sooner or later , ##OTHER 
 start meeting the political and technical commitments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  
 we need to make . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)  
If we take action , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 we 'll have to justify ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 why we should be following this lead .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
