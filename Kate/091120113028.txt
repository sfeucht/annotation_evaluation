When California 's Mendicino County publishes it annual farm production census this spring ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 agricultural Commissioner Ted Erickson will dutifully report  ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 that wine grapes are the county 's No. 1 crop . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
That 's not true ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 and Eriksen knows it . ##BASIC STATE 
But the Mendicino Board of Supervisors and California state officials have ordered him not to report on the county 's most lucrative farm crop  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 -- marijuana . ##OTHER 
Marijuana growing is a $100-million-a-year business in Mendicino ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 Eriksen estimates ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 so big ##OTHER 
 it makes the county 's $20 million worth of grapes look like small potatoes . ##BASIC STATE 
After years of ignoring illegal marijuana farming , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Eriksen finally included the crop in his annual report last year . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
He might as well have lit a joint in the courthouse . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
There was such a flap  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 that Eriksen had to tear the marijuana page out of every issue of his annual report  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 and promise never to report on pot again . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
" A lot of people feel  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that if you do n't mention it ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 it 'll go away ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 " says Eriksen . ##BASIC STATE 
" The fact  ##OTHER 
 is that this is an illegal crop ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but it has tremendous impact on the economy of Mendocino County . " ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Mendocino is one of 17 northern California counties  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 in which Marijuana farming has reached such a scale  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 that federal agents have been sent in to try and stop it . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
Until recently the marijuana business was dominated by imports ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 primarily from Columbia . ##OTHER
But ##OTHER 
 while U.S. steel and automakers are pleading for protection from imports  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and the nation 's producers of shoes and television sets are struggling to survive against foreign competition ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 the domestic pot industry is proving  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 it can beat the imports . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
American Marijuana growers harvested a record crop last year ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
well over 1,000 metric tons of the illegal herb ,  ##OTHER 
 federal authorities and private marijuana specialists estimate . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Federal Drug Enforcement Administration statistics released a few days ago  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 show U.S. marijuana production growing at a rate  ##BASIC STATE 
 of better than 20 percent a year , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 while marijuana imports are up only about 13 percent . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
The agency estimates ##BASIC STATE 
 Americans smoked  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 marijuana worth between $15.5 billion and $21.9 billion in 1979.Perhaps $2 billion to $3 billion worth was grown in the United States . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
By comparison ,  ##OTHER 
 U.S. tobacco production was worth $17 billion that year . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Once considered a youthful indulgence , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 marijuana has gained increasing acceptance among adults ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 the DEA said . ##BASIC STATE 
Use of the drug by youths 12 to 17 is " leveling off " the agency reported ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but " there was an unexpected persistence in marijuana use between 1977 and 1979 among older adults  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 ( over 26 )  ##OTHER 
 who used Marijuana in their youth . " ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
The rapid growth of marijuana cultivation has for the first time forced the DEA to switch some of its law enforcement effort  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 from trying to stop smuggling  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and to concentrating on catching domestic producers . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Commercial marijuana growing began in the United States only about five years ago ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and already homegrown pot accounts for an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent of the 14,000 to 15,000 tons  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 smoked each year . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Measured in dollars ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the domestic pot growers have captured an even bigger share of the market ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 because their product sells for two to 10 times as much as imported marijuana .  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
As if they had taken a percentage lesson from Madison Avenue ,  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 U.S. marijuana farmers are cashing in by concentrating on the luxury market ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 -- producing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 what even the DEA admits  ##BASIC STATE 
 if the best marijuana available  ##OTHER 
 and charging premium prices for it . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Domestic growers have used designer genitics  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to produce pot many times more potent than garden-variety grass . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
They 've even given it  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 what amounts to a brand name  ##BASIC STATE 
 -- " sinsemilla . " ##OTHER 
The word is an amalgam of the two Spanish words  ##BASIC STATE 
 meaning " seedless "  ##BASIC STATE 
 but has come to imply champagne-quality homegrown marijuana . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
U.S. growers are getting $100 to to $200 an ounce for their sinsemilla , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 while Columbian grass sells for $40 or less . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
And  ##OTHER 
 because the channels of distribution are much shorter for American marijuana  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 -- much of it is sold directly by the growers --  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the domestic producers are making far greater profit . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
On an investment of $3,000 or less ,  ##OTHE R
a grower can easily produce a marijuana crop worth $100,000 , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 says David Schickedanz ,  ##BASIC STATE 
coordinator of the first federal effort  ##OTHER 
 to try to eradicate the infant industry ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 before it gets any bigger . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Between June and October of last year , ##OTHER 
 local , state and federal agents  ##OTHER 
 participating in the DEA 's " Operation Sinsemilla " raided 740 pot plots , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 arrested 527 persons ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 and seized 129,329 marijuana plants ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 weighing more than a total of 220,000 pounds . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Counting another ton of processed pot ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 that was seized , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 the operation netted an estimated $131.5 million worth of marijuana . ##BASIC STATE 
All the seizures and arrests were made in 17 norther California counties ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 ( including Mendocino ) ##OTHER 
 where serious marijuana growing apparently got its start ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and is the most prevalent . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
California and Hawaii are the leading marijuana growing states ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 reports the DEA . ##BASIC STATE 
" We 're not saying ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 it 's just Claifornia and Hawaii ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 " stressed Schickedanz . ##BASIC STATE 
" You 'll find it in every state  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 that has a growing season long enough for vegetables . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Anybody  ##OTHER 
 who can grow a tomato  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 can grow marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
When the DEA began cracking down in northern California , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 growers moved over the border into Oregon . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Arkansas is rapidly building a reputation ##BASIC STATE 
 as California 's rival , ##OTHER 
 say officials of the national Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws  ##BASIC STATE 
 ( NORML ) . ##OTHER 
They contend  ##BASIC STATE 
 marijuana is grown in every state and the District of Columbia , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 where much of it is cultivated indoors . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Campaigning for the right ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to grow grass for personal consumption  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 is the latest move for the group , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which until now has stressed efforts  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to ease or erase criminal penalties for possession of small amounts . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Only Alaska now permits people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to grow their own grass , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 said George Farnham , ##BASIC STATE 
the young lawyer  ##OTHER
 who serves as a political director of NORMAL . ##BASIC STATE 
In most states , ##OTHER 
growing marijuana is a far more serious crime than getting caught with an ounce or less . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Many state laws treat cultivation of even a single marijuana plant with the same severity as selling drugs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 imposing mandatory prison sentences . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Farnhan says U.S. grass growers " benefit the U.S. economy ##BASIC STATE 
 by keeping the money in the country  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 instead of giving it to Columbia . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
It helps our balance of payments . " ##BASIC STATE
Buying marijuana from a " hippie farmer in Arkansas " is better than getting it from a multinational smuggling ring ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 he argues . ##BASIC STATE 
Government efforts  ##OTHER 
 to halt foreign marijuana production and smuggling ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
especially the spraying of the poison paraquat on marijuana fields , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 lead pot smokers to start growing their own , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 the NORML lawyer suggested . ##BASIC STATE 
Fear of paraquat and the Mexican government 's success in curtailing marijuana cultivation ##OTHER
 have cut imports of the Mexican variety ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 sharply ,  ##OTHER 
 the DEA says . ##BASIC STATE 
From 2,200 tons in 1978 ,  ##OTHER 
Mexico 's supply to the U.S. fell to at most 1,500 tons in 1979 . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Imports of Jamaican " ganga " doubled ,  ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
however , ##OTHER 
 as troubles in the economy of that island nation lead more Jamaicans  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 to turn to growing and smuggling . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Colombia remains the main supplier ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 exporting an estimated 10,100 tons of marijuana to the United States in 1979 . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Smuggling has grown to such an organized level  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 that twice in 1979 U.S. drug agents intercepted shipments of 50 tons of marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 -- an entire shipload . ##OTHER 
Marijuana weed , ##OTHER 
 also known as the hemp plant ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 was cultivated for rope in midwestern states during World War II  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and still grows wild in much of the country . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But marijuana smokers learned long ago  ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 that wild weeds do n't have the desired impact . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
The plants are very low  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 in cannabis resin and in tetrahydrocannabinol  ##OTHER 
 ( Thc ) , the ingredient  ##OTHER 
 that makes users " high . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
" People used to look down their noses at homegrown , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 " Farnham says ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 " but now when you 're talking homegrown ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 you 're talking about the best marijuana in the world . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
American marijuana is considered more desirable ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 he explained ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 because growers have learned ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 how to increase the THC content  ##OTHER
 and grow a crop many times more potent than the imported variety . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The most potent California marijuana contains as much as 6 percent pure THC ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 agreed DEA agent Schickedanz ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 while ordinary grass has as little as 0.05 percent of the psychoactive chemical . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
To make their stuff stronger ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 pot farmers plant a different variety . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
The marijuana  ##OTHER 
 grown in Mexico , Colombia and Jamaica and the wild weed in the United States is a plant  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 called cannabis satavia . ##BASIC STATE 
Another variety grows in Asia ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 cannabis indicia ,  ##OTHER 
 containing much more resin . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Americans in Vietnam developed a taste for the Eastern variety ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and brought the seeds home with them . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But the secret of sinsemilla is in the growing . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
The cultivators emasculate their marijuana patches , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 culling out the male plants as soon  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 as their sex can be determined . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Struggling futiley  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to reproduce without males ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 the frustrated females pour all their energy into producing THC ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 because the sticky chemical helps trap pollen . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
The result is a monster marijuana plant  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 -- 10 to 20 feet tall ,  ##OTHER 
 vivid green ,  ##OTHER 
 bushy as a Christmas tree ##OTHER  
 and literally dripping with THC . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
DEA officials estimate  ##BASIC STATE 
 that each sinsemilla plant will yield an average of a pound of pot , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and some will produce two or even three pounds . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Both DEA and NORML representatives agree ##BASIC STATE 
 that $1,000 a pound is the going price for sinsemilla in that quantity. ##BASIC STATE 
The smoker ##OTHER 
 who buys ##OTHER 
 an ounce will probably pay $100 to $200 for it , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 pushing the value of a pound to $2,000 or $3,000 . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Government drug officials in the past have been accused of inflating the value of drugs ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to exaggerate their danger . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But DEA estimates of sinsemilla output  ##BASIC STATE 
 are based on the one-pound-to-the-plant ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
$1,000-a-pound rule ,  ##OTHER 
 and NORML officials say  ##BASIC STATE 
 the government numbers are ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
if anything , ##OTHER 
on the low side . ##OTHER 
But the pro - and antimarijuana forces disagree on other aspects of marijuana growing . ##BASIC STATE 
The people  ##OTHER 
 who want to legalize pot describe a cottage industry right out of " The Greening of America " with friendly folks  ##BASIC STATE  
 who , ##OTHER 
 as Farnham puts it , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 " grow a little grass for themselves and their friends . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
DEA talks of marijuana millionaires , pot plantations and staggering profits . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
A single sensimilla plant will yield 1,500 hand-rolled joints of marijuana too potent for most smokers to consume by themselves . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
" One plant is enough  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to keep somebody stoned out of their mind for a year , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 " said Schickedanz . ##BASIC STATE 
Each plant requires a plot about three feet in diameter , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 so a moderate-sized garden will produce 100 plants  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 yielding $100,000 worth of sinsemilla ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 the DEA agent noted . ##BASIC STATE 
The biggest grower  ##OTHER 
 busted by the DEA in its California raids had 7,200 plants , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
worth at least $7 million . ##OTHER 
With a crop that valuable ,  ##OTHER 
 the growers do n't just throw their seeds in the ground  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and wait for the harvest ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 Schickendanz said . ##BASIC STATE 
About this time of year  ##OTHER 
 they start the seeds in individual planting pots ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 just like tomatoes or cabbages . ##OTHER 
In the spring ,  ##OTHER 
the seedlings are transplanted outside . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
( Urban growers often produce pot in a closet ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 using fancy lighting systems  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)  
 that produce the wavelengths  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 
 the plants prefer . ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
Deer , rabbits and other garden pests love the leafy marijuana plants ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 so most of the serious growers fence their plots with chicken wire or woven wire fencing . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
To keep out burrowing creatures ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
 they extend the wire underground ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and to keep out poachers ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
 more than a few plots have burglar alarms . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Schickedanz said  ##BASIC STATE 
 one of the California growers  ##OTHER 
 his group caught last year had installed two above-ground swimming pools ##NONSENSE 
 to hold water and liquid fertilizer for his marijuana garden . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC0 
" He 'd hooked up a couple of pumps . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
All  ##OTHER 
 he had to do was step out of his cabin  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 and hit a switch ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
the first pump would run  ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 until the plants got their water ,  ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 then shut off automatically . ##OTHER
Then a second pump would give them the fertilizer . " ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
The DEA agent estimates ##BASIC STATE 
 " Operation Sinsemilla " wiped out 20 percent to 40 percent of the marijuana crop in northern California last year . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
But ,  ##OTHER  
 he admitted reluctantly ,  ##BASIC STATE 
 " I personally do n't think  ##BASIC STATE 
 we 'll ever stop it . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
