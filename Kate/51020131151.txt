Have we missed anything here on health , ##QUESTION
 or having a fatty might that ? ##NONSENSE 
So what if we in fact are currently boasting ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that recreational weed will affect the waistline ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Or are our deeper concerns about food ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 being too much , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
or not enough ,  ##OTHER 
 to be worthy of the title of modern-day WHO ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Surely it 's obvious that the internet is far more active than usual ##BASIC STATE 
 and often features big names on its front page , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and a few of them are n't getting any coverage on their website .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
But the much more so public debate ##OTHER 
 surrounding the matter will not be over here . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Many people will see the argument for and against the cannabis industry as unlikely , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
and only ##OTHER 
 because they just do n't have a track record ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 of having created such a fertile ground for the findings .##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Will we be happy to pick up on any anecdotes like the one around the middle of this week ##QUESTION 
 that are just plain plain untrue ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
It 's coming : ##BASIC STATE 
 the headlines like this : ##OTHER
 Golden Cup & Nicera # 100 leaf , only cannabis was legal in San Francisco . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Good news for cannabis advocates ! ##OTHER 
Restaurants fear legalisation of # cannabis due to surge in cannabis sales . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Legalisation is on the horizon , ##BASIC STATE 
 Deal keeps New Yorkers out of city , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and so on . ##OTHER 
And therein lies the rub . ##BASIC STATE 
This is not just the widespread fear for the industry and the general national picture . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Some of the authors seem to have moved on from previous work , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and are quickly retreating again .##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
All of them seem to have moved on to work . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Is there anything more distressing , ##QUESTION 
 and perhaps more damaging , ##OTHER
in the way ##OTHER 
 that the folk  ##OTHER 
 that contribute to it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 are supposed to present themselves in the way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they present themselves ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and what they say ? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Is that how a bunch of light-hearted exponents of a healthy lifestyle feel ? ##QUESTION 
Does anyone really believe them anymore ? ##QUESTION 
If they 're indeed the peddlers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that they 're the problem here , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 do n't they feel ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 they should stop selling ,  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and just accept ? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Once again , ##OTHER 
the argument takes a back seat to that of cannabis and health . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Or , ##OTHER 
 to put it like this , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 marijuana is rarely widely used , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but there is a debate about whether a growing number of independent dispensaries have a right ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to market their products like wine , beer and mayonnaise .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
In fact , ##OTHER 
 the impact on health of the synthetic cannabis industry is immeasurable . ##BASIC STATE 
So how would the arguments over these challenges in state legislatures work ? ##QUESTION 
The answer is very complicated . ##BASIC STATE 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , ##BASIC STATE 
 0.4 percent of the population has marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Today it 's 2.7 percent . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Several states have passed laws ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that protect these users against legal dangers for marijuana use . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
There is none for recreational use . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
And those in favor of medical marijuana generally like the idea ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 of supporting the industry , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 rather than stigmatising it . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
But may the argument be a little hard to win over ? ##QUESTION
Who cares about convictions , discretion , and occasional joy-filled moments ? ##QUESTION 
So far ,  ##OTHER 
most states have pursued new laws  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to protect patients from pot and marijuana from cannabis .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC0 
But there is significant opposition to this law , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which involves the presumption ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that people on medical / non-medical grounds and whoever 's in the position ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to sign up to it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 must be careful to avoid being too much in the wrong ,  ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 nor having ulterior motives . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE 
But the evidence on popularity and policy ##OTHER 
 has proved very poorly ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and is simply not compelling . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
This newspaper points out ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 that while the documentary film clip about the Marihuana Marketplace in Boston was quite widely circulated , ##BASIC STATE 
 only 36 people of that population tested positive for marijuana .##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
Ultimately , ##OTHER 
it takes the very best arguments on both sides ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to win ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and to see the arguments re-emerge . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
And it 's very difficult to get away from such pitting . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I understand ##BASIC STATE 
 that some " obey-up " rumours can be over the line , ##GNERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but I do n't like being woken up at 7am by dizzying science surveys ##BASIC STATE 
 and convinced ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 I can no longer rely on any of them for information . ##BASIC STATE 
And those were only the movies ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 in which the argument over coffee careered off into the sticky pot . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
There may be more good news than worse . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
But we have a long way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to go ##UNBOUNDED EVENT 
 before we can say anymore . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
