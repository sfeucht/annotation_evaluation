Thank you . ##BASIC STATE 
People downplay the mental effects of weed too much . #GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
It 's the same thing with alcohol . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Not everyone ##OTHER 
 who drinks will end up with problems ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 ( though many do ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and they either deal with it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 or quit. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
It 's literally the same thing with weed . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
And a large portion of people ##OTHER 
 who smoke weed ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 and might have some mental effects ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 just continue smoking , ##IMPERATIVE
 so they never find out ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 what those effects are . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
People say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 weed is n't addictive , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but I can tell you ##BASIC STATE 
 there definitely is a craving sensation ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 after you smoke for a while . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Plus , ##OTHER 
you feel shitty without weed ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 if you 've been toking constantly for a long time . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Is n't that the same thing as withdrawal ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
If not in a physical sense , ##OTHER  
 then in a mental sense ##OTHER 
 ( due to lack of cannabinoids in the brain ##OTHER
 lifting your mood ) .##OTHER
Then again , ##OTHER 
 since the brain ##OTHER 
 is a physical organ , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 maybe ##OTHER 
 it is physical. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
But ##OTHER 
 I digress , ##BASIC STATE  
 some people can deal with it just fine - ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but there are downsides to consistent weed usage . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Mainly mental . ##OTHER 
It makes you lazy as shit compared to if you were sober . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
It can lead to depression , anxiety , or just lowered motivation ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and drive in general . ##OTHER 
It 's funny ##BASIC STATE 
 because all these kinds of weed downsides were commonly referenced by stoners themselves or stoner movies , songs , etc . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
I 'm not saying ##BASIC STATE 
 that everybody will experience these things , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but that they are a real possibility .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This kind of reminds me of the backlash ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 people would get ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 when someone pointed out the deleterious effects of cigarettes or alcohol back in the day - ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 I 'm talking about decades ago . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Most people said ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 they were fine ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and that it was bullshit . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
But look ##OTHER 
 where we are today . ##OTHER 
I think ##BASIC STATE 
 it 'll take time ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 until people calm down ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 and actually assess the situation.##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I 'm all for legalization and recreational use . ##BASIC STATE 
But seriously , ##OTHER 
all things in moderation . ##OTHER
