Logically you 're correct that , ##BASIC STATE 
 no , ##OTHER 
there is no inherent contradiction between the two positions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but what 's notable about the two positions ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 is that particular principles automatically fail ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 because they contradict at least one of the two positions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
This is similar to the potential opposite view , ##BASIC STATE 
 being Pro Choice but also Anti Death Penalty . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
For the first one , ##OTHER 
 you ca n't hold the principle ##BASIC STATE 
 " Killing another human being is only morally permissible in self defense " , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 because the Death Penalty is not an act of self defense .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Similarly , ##OTHER 
you ca n't hold the principle ##BASIC STATE 
 if you 're pro-choice and anti-death penalty ##BASIC STATE 
 as abortion is not an act of self defense . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
( You could get around this though by defining a fetus as not a human being , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 but you do run into the issue of defining human being ##BASIC STATE 
 more clearly ) ##OTHER 
For example , ##OTHER 
 if I gave you the political positions of ##BASIC STATE 
" I am in favor of legalizing marijuana " ##BASIC STATE 
 and " I am in favor of increasing foreign aid " , ##BASIC STATE 
 there is n't generally an issue . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Any principle ##OTHER 
 that would support legalizing marijuana ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 will not usually come into conflict with a position ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 regarding foreign aid . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
But with an issue like Pro-Life vs ##OTHER 
 Pro-Choice and regarding the death penalty , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 both involve issues of human life ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 directly being killed , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
so any principles ##OTHER 
 that support ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 one must not come into conflict with the other , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)  
 or else you risk acting in contradiction to your own beliefs . ##BASIC STATE //2
They may not be contradictory , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but they these ideas are in conflict ##NONSENSE 
 with which principles will allow both .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
