It is good and evil to take the side of those  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who harm others from a vaccine induced problem ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 Talking drug of choice for the wrong cause ##NONSENSE 
 I learnt ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)  
 it is good to take the side of those ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who harm others from a vaccine induced problem .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Unfortunately , ##OTHER 
I did n't believe ##BASIC STATE 
 people ##OTHER 
 who experimented on my child today ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 would do it again ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 or the harm ##OTHER 
 I had caused them ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 has been detected . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
I did educate people on medicinal use of marijuana , methamphetamine , and peri-psilocybin . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
MY first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions ##BASIC STATE 
 but on the other hand I missed the beneficial effects of the drug for such a long time .##BASIC STATE 
My friend Marie from London told me ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 the migraines were just as serious ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and I asked her why .##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Yet I did n't take any information out of the children ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 who were so ignorant on medicinal uses of cannabis , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and wrote down the positive things ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 that she had learned from her research about medicinal use of cannabis , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 even if this information came directly from others .##BASIC STATE 
The simple truth is that someone ##BASIC STATE 
 who has an addictive drug will generally do well once they get it with the other ingredients . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
And ##OTHER 
 without a prescription , ##OTHER 
 they would n't be overdoing it . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
For any adults , ##OTHER 
their parents or friends , ##OTHER  
 who do a lot of drugs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 many are probably too ignorant to understand ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 what is wrong with them and the drugs ##QUESTION 
 to do nothing about it .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
However , ##OTHER 
 in these days of drug addiction  ##OTHER 
 it is best to avoid alcohol , painkillers , pain relievers and psychedelics such as tequila , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 the latter more toxic than marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and drugs ##OTHER 
 known as terpenes ##OTHER 
 tend to lead to powerful and long lasting reactions in a manner ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 that is at odds with what is available in the marketplace .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Things go wrong with these drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 when cannabis is both unregulated and unregulated in a way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 we rarely hear about because they are illegal .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
It has the potential ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to create a brain , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
 which was destroyed by psychotic lovers ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 who drank and smoked it for months on end .##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Before many people have their worst experience of cannabis in their parents ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 they should have their best chance ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 of buying it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and making more of it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to stop the drug from developing in the first place . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
As much as there are people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who go on drugs ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 they become addictive ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and make you feel great , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 they start to have negative feelings . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Being in school or driving around in the morning ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 or while going to school , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 does not have an addictive effect ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that will ruin your child 's life or their studies . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
I felt glad ##BASIC STATE
 I never took an overdose because of the pain ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 and brought more happiness to myself and my family . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
As I have written before , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 it is important that anyone ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 who has someone ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 who has ever done drugs of choice ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 take steps ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 to reduce his or her risks of opioid dependence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)  
 by monitoring their cell phone activity ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and taking random medication .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
That includes talking to experts  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to find out ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 what risks are present in your loved one , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and getting advice from doctors ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to prescribe less harmful medications . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
The biggest problem ##OTHER 
 with these drugs is that they have no stimulant ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and can take a long time ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 to free up energy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 and increase protein production .##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
We treat alcohol consumption as a part of a normal life ; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 heroin users are not drug users , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 alcohol use is not a problem , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and there are no known adverse side effects from legal methods such as smoking cigarettes . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
A good education is necessary ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 before you get in the habit of engaging in regular drugs of choice such as heroin and other painkillers . ##BASIC STATE 
For people ##OTHER 
 who do use opiates like Xanax and Molly , or opium , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 heroin is safer than legal street drugs such as Oxycontin and Vicodin ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and will help heal chronic pain and anger management . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
One of the best educational articles ##OTHER 
 I wrote in 2014 about these activities ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 was Rosalind Denton 's Curious Citizenship , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which talked about personal experiences for kids ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 who are addicted to substances .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
My first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions ##BASIC STATE 
 and was an educational exercise .##BASIC STATE 
As the pain grew , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 I realized ##BASIC STATE 
 how many other people around me had similar experiences . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Having witnessed it firsthand ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 I realised ##BASIC STATE 
 that it is hard not to get sick , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 especially with the regular dose of opioids . ##OTHER
