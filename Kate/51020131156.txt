This week Ill be taking you to a long but not overt speech of religious significance . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
I want to bring you closer to the time ##BASIC STATE 
 when those ##OTHER 
 who enjoy liquor as punishment and pardon ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 use it as peace and order ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 to begin some long holiday celebrations .##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
No-one can beat the booze ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and some of those ##OTHER 
 celebrating these rituals in their sleep have a strong social bias against alcohol . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Instead , ##OTHER 
they elect to drink more in reaction to changing circumstances and in their mind , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 which makes them a lot less tolerant , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 in some cases ##OTHER 
 as you probably know . ##BASIC STATE 
Few parties survive to the end , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 and its even harder to make friends with your friends of your own intellectual or visual persuasion . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
Seasoned young people go to party spots now ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that make up less than 10 % of the population .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
That is not how I see it .##BASIC STATE 
Sooner or later that will change ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 as it has in both maths and a lot of scholarly literature and scholarly culture and times  ##PERFECT COERCED STATE
 we are already living in . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
At the very least , ##OTHER 
 there may be a need for a private and public place as soon as possible ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to share these experiences . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
Yet still others are forced to pick up just too little oxygen in the night sometimes so much ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
 that it tears at your already established ego ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 or hurts ##OTHER 
 what good ##QUESTION 
 you can accomplish . ##BASIC STATE 
This might be for the great causes , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 but with a bit of awareness ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 one could even take the seed of the ideas of those ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 I abhor the old things in various ways .##BASIC STATE 
There are fun texts about the social values of alcohol and pot .##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
There are men and women ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 rethinking the ways ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 of alcohol and drugs ##OTHER 
 taping our minds about the road ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 of shame . ##OTHER 
In many of these conversations ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 there is the light at the end of the tunnel and an aspiration for change . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
But there are far more exciting ways ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to involve ourselves as Homo sapiens in our growing and much more exciting lives ,  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
than alcohol and drugs in the narrow circle of politics , dialogue and anthropology . ##OTHER 
Back at the bus stop . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)  
People ask me ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 where we are from , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 but I think ##BASIC STATE 
 we are from a few places . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Back in the Day of the Indian and Chinese Diaspora . ##OTHER 
Back in 1967 when the Indian wars were all but over , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 Indian Gen. Myron Joseph Benben talked to me about his stint in Pakistan .##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
I think ##BASIC STATE 
 he was like that for all of the students in his generation . ##BASIC STATE 
He met a woman from Tibet . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
I know both of those kids for a fact . ##BASIC STATE
It was at that time ##BASIC STATE 
 that a wave of Indian immigrants to the US first sailed on the Potomac ##BOUNDED EVENT (STATIC) 
 and took over our town . ##BOUNDED EVENT (STATIC) 
Back then , ##OTHER 
 I think of you ##BASIC STATE 
 as kind of the agnostic at home , ##OTHER  
the one with a full faith in the cause of all life in its most nourishing and ignorable conditions ,  ##BASIC STATE 
the person ##OTHER 
 who keeps a mental resume with an acre of rice ##BASIC STATE 
 and a trusted family with a waiting list of vital supplies ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that allow them to ride on the boat and through the mud . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
All this while you kept putting you into interviews , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 or even running short stories on the end ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 these deep and intimate conversations reveal in the writing  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 what you think of the world as a marriage of love and the hopes of its parents , ##BASIC STATE 
 that have eaten the less fortunate into oblivion , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 that you and your family are destined for the very real threat of more wasted lives , ##BASIC STATE 
 less well fed and more demoralised and unemployed .##BASIC STATE 
Maybe at this point its not going to be adequate encouragement ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for our fledgling novelist / artists in a time of need .##OTHER
But hey , ##OTHER 
you know ##BASIC STATE
 who would have a message for us ? ##QUESTION
