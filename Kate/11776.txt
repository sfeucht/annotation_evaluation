You know ... ##BASIC STATE 
There was a time ##BASIC STATE 
 when I probably would have agreed with you . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
In the 1960's , 1970's ##OTHER 
 when we were really just entering the age of the large administrative state ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 and were trying to figure out ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 how to write huge laws of general application ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //1 
I would have been a big proponent of writing broad laws ##BASIC STATE 
 and then allowing prosecutors to use their discretion in their application ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 to make sure ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 the intent of the law was done. ##BASIC STATE
Then we started locking up like half of all african american men , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 and more people than any other country in the world . ##OTHER
We started to absolutely crush people 's lives ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 because they did n't want to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple .##BASIC STATE //3 
We expanded the scope of laws ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)   
 a thousand fold , ##OTHER 
 and we got affluenza kid . ##BASIC STATE //1 
We got teenagers ##BASIC STATE //1 
 being charged with manufacturing child pornography cause ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 they sent ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) 
 their bf a topless pic ##OTHER 
 and their teacher took their phone ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 and searched it without their consent. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
So you know , ##BASIC STATE 
 I am completely done with the idea ##BASIC STATE 
 that special people should n't be treated the same way . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
I think ##BASIC STATE 
 if Hillary Clinton got caught smoking weed ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 she should go to jail for as long as a black 25 year old with a criminal record. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
Either ##OTHER 
 the laws apply to the king as much ##BASIC STATE 
 as they do the lowest person , ##BASIC STATE //2 
 or we revert to the 1600's. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
Do you know ##BASIC STATE
 we have more people in jail by a percentage of our population than Russia , Iran , or China ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
