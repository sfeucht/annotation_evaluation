When you visit your GP , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 can you fully consume a day of cannabis and alcohol ##QUESTION
 without feeling ##BASIC STATE
 like you 're being overdone ? ##
It may sound rude , 
 but it 's the same thing as with alcohol .
The Western world is currently experiencing a huge increase in cannabis consumption among the young , 
 to the point 
 where it 's now a huge taboo subject .
Some believe 
 a few hours of self-administering cannabis can actually reduce your risk of a major illness .
That 's not exactly true : 
 according to data 
 released by Addiction Research International , 
 which surveyed almost 6,000 patients in 24 countries on all sorts of subjects , 
 the world 's population 
 is consuming more than two-thirds of the world 's cannabis .
According to the research , 
 almost 2-1/2 million women in the world are taking two or more cannabis-containing substances each day , 
 with around half having attempted at least one .
What 's behind this rise ?
Can you call it a " psychological black hole " ?
The only answer is a guess .
Most adults do n't get impaired , 
 but substance misuse is problematic , 
 and with the growing number of self-help books 
 recommending self-help and peer advice , 
 there 's not much you can do about it .
Studies suggest 
 that cannabis could actually help someone with cognitive impairment , 
 which is a limitation of alcohol 
 when it comes to the mental and physical health effects of cannabis .
Can you do the same ?
It 's more likely 
 you need meds and alcohol , 
 but maybe you want to wait .
For this reason , 
 it 's not surprising that up to seven-and-a-half percent of younger Canadians admit to taking cannabis .
This is when the potential 
 for harm is most likely to occur .
