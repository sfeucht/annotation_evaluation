national This was not the 1960s , ##BASIC STATE
 but more recent pop culture trends have made it more palatable The Los Angeles Times has put the influence of punk rock in modern pop music on a pop history chronicle , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 helping bring us the end of hippieism , the peak of hippie media ##UNBOUNDED EVENT //3
 until it shut down the whole music scene and its agency . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
This is the best of the legacy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 left by an uninspired vision ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of what would be the legacy of hippie pop culture . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
According to the American Civil Liberties Union , more than 50 percent of American adults believe ##BASIC STATE
 the people ##OTHER
 around them should not be incarcerated or charged with crimes , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 with the highest rate in the US partly due to the federal prison system . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Thus , sabotage , ##OTHER
 said the ACLU , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 is more than just a criminal offense . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
These two main problems of the hippie movement are political and civic and they cannot be resolved without the public , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and therefore , the drug drugs . ##NONSENSE
This brings us to the story of Felony Narcotics ##BASIC STATE
 ( Picture ##OTHER
 recorded by Billie Holiday ) ##NONSENSE
 it is clear that the internet helped to create this civilian revolution . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
The United States had a monopoly on the criminal justice system during the countrys expansion , ##BASIC STATE
 and it must be acknowledged ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that with the closure of the criminal justice system , ##OTHER
 many of these personal matters could become politically explosive ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and go against the broader political agenda . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Just to keep in mind ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that it will be a while ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 before all those behind the Pablo Escobar case get to plead guilty , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 but this current thought process ##OTHER
 regarding the not winning of the war against drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 is having a detrimental effect . ##BASIC STATE
We recently saw about 25 activists , mostly in the US , ##BOUNDED EVENT
 go to jail ##BOUNDED EVENT
 after an anti-war group successfully argued an appeal of their conviction , ##BOUNDED EVENT
 resulting in punitive sanctions against the organizers . ##BOUNDED EVENT
The protestors ##OTHER
 were jailed ##BOUNDED EVENT
 before their appeal was heard , ##BOUNDED EVENT
 yet all proceeds from this appeal were going toward social service and public aid programs . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
There are also many times ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 where the incarceration of innocent people over drugs is a way ##BASIC STATE
 to take away talent ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and develop contacts and infrastructure ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to make even minor actions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 some of which have been legal . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Many officials of the US Border Patrol have been overcompensated with incarceration . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
A recent example is it was implemented in Pakistan ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 to prevent searches of immigrants ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 ( although domestic immigrant crime has far surpassed any drug crime in the US ) . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The Trump administration is also aware of this ##BASIC STATE
 and was constantly threatening the deportation of innocent people . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
One example is the suspect in the alleged murder of a US citizen . ##BASIC STATE
This case is very different from those ##BASIC STATE
 we witness as adults , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 when in the last few years people are in detention due to being young and by reason of a moral or political decision ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
 not to be aggressive about their arrest . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It is not only the drug users ##BASIC STATE
 who say this , yet another group ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that is trying to disrupt these important civil rights issues . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
This is why there are many regular media reports ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 blaming the rioters of Latin America ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that when they try to stop them from being trapped in the DEA , ##NONSENSE
 to avoid facing the gangster punishment ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 imposed on the group by the Obama administration . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
The policy behind these revelations is callous and premeditated . ##BASIC STATE
This was not the 1960s , ##BASIC STATE
 but more recent pop culture trends have made it more palatable . ##BASIC STATE
These discussions have mostly focused on issues like mass incarceration . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It is not evident why , ##BASIC STATE
 but I will concede ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
 that other debates , ##OTHER
 such as the mysterious sexism ##OTHER
 that has infiltrated our media , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 may lead to something more profound ##BASIC STATE
 than just the monologue of a talk show host , Sexism is a Stupid Thing and even the use of drones or celebrities as examples ##BASIC STATE*
 to further disturb and delay justice . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
If people understand ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that society is about substance abuse , environmental degradation , gender inequality , and gay marriage issues , ##BASIC STATE*
 this may facilitate a profound change of attitude . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
There is also the sense ##BASIC STATE
 that if we ever really say , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 its my responsibility to stop this illegal trend , ##BASIC STATE
 and if the mass incarceration of criminalized people is somehow the cause , ##BASIC STATE
 it should invite other civil rights issues . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
It is essential for us ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as Americans to support the enforcement of justice , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
 be more considerate of the rights of others , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
 and act responsibly . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
I am very grateful for this new legacy of our youth and for the passion in our communities ##BASIC STATE
 to fight against criminalization . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
That moral and legal recognition should invite more discussions about the terrible effects of mass incarceration and its negative effect on the communities of color . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
