 The concept of cannabis can be confused with the specific method ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 used ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to get the plants out Its not just about taking pot ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
 and avoiding stoned smokers but a whole lot of things about marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 that explains ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 why its associated with so many things about us . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In fact , its absolutely the reason ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 why drugs take off ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 How are we ##QUESTION
 supposed ##QUESTION
 to understand this ? ##QUESTION
Ill stop with the technical details , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
 because it makes sense : ##BASIC STATE
 For the first time , ##OTHER
 researchers at California State University , Long Beach looked at a genetic sequence ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 called the Paropycula protein ##BASIC STATE
 that helps determine ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 which genes are active in humans at certain levels of activity . ##BASIC STATE
They then linked it to cannabis effect the brains ability ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 to process and transmit information at a mental level . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The signal was real . ##BASIC STATE
And surprisingly , we only have four more chapters ##BASIC STATE*
 left on the patenting of this protein . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Cannabis effect on fetal brain development This suggests ##BASIC STATE
 cannabis affect fetal brain development ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 while still holding the same gene responsible for hydration and glucose function . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)*
And ##OTHER
 while it may explain the effectiveness of these two drugs , ##BASIC STATE
 this , more than just a genetic explanation , does not answer a whole lot of other questions about cannabis . ##BASIC STATE*
Maybe we need to be careful ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that the two drugs interferes ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 not when it comes to regulating the range of chemistry within the brain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
 and thinking processes of this brain . ##OTHER
Well , still , this doesnt answer more serious questions about the importance of cannabis in brain development , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 like which drugs we should apply to this cortex : ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
 What is the brain thinking process ? ##QUESTION
When we make and distribute marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 the cortex we have is responsible for filtering the most frequently studied process ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 of processing information ##OTHER
 and then making appropriate use of it ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to make those processes work efficiently . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Cannabis affects brain development , brain matter , and even metabolism . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Its through this process ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that we can tell ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 whether the development of a fetus is functioning properly . ##BASIC STATE
And ##OTHER
 if it isnt , ##BASIC STATE
 then a fetus growth is going to pick up on different things in the brain . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
Cannabis influence continues to grow at the other end , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 and it also raises new questions . ##BASIC STATE
Is cannabis permanently destroying the brain ##QUESTION
 and learning ? ##QUESTION
What about the intellectual potential of the brain ? ##QUESTION
What is mental capacity on the system ? ##QUESTION*
Is it any good ? ##QUESTION
I guess ##BASIC STATE
 it depends ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 how many chemicals we dont look at . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Theyre all at the same level of output , ##BASIC STATE //3
 but theyre a product in your cartilage , ##BASIC STATE* //3
 like a pottery pot . ##OTHER*
You still wont replace it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 if you stop the plant ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 before you remove it . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But ##OTHER
 if you go back to smoking pot ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to the same manner ##OTHER
 the plant crops up its probably not going to seed ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 but , for some reason , ##OTHER
 it still plants to try and replace it . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
Hannah Jungers is a specialist in C-level brain chemistry . ##BASIC STATE
