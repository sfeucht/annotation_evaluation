I thought initially ##BASIC STATE
 you were going to argue for a confederate system ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 but you are basically asking for a unitary system . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
I think ##BASIC STATE
 federalism is a good compromise ##BASIC STATE
 because different states have different values.. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
take for example marijuana . ##IMPERATIVE
In a unitary system we would not have States were marijuana is legal . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
That would require congress to approve ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and right now there is little support among conservatives ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so at least some liberal states are passing marijuana laws . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
Since federalism allows states to experiment ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 it leads to congress being able to observe the results . ##BASIC STATE
Eventually marijuana will be legal in all 59 states ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 but if no state took any risk ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 to see ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 what would happen ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if it was made legal ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 it would take much longer . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Same thing with same sex marriage . ##BASIC STATE
As late as 2008 a majority of Americans were against same sex marriage ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but it allowed some states to legalize it ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 and the Supreme Court eventually legalized it everywhere . ##BOUNDED EVENT
One recent example is trump wants to get rid of emissions requirements for cars . ##BASIC STATE
Basically Obama made a law ##BOUNDED EVENT
 saying ##BOUNDED EVENT
 that cars needed to incrementally be more energy efficient . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
California put up their own emissions requirements ##BOUNDED EVENT
 so since they are so big ##BASIC STATE
 car manufacturers are just applying it to all its cars . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Trump is currently in a legal battle with California over this issue . ##BASIC STATE
If we had a unitary system ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 we States wouldnt be able to put up their own efficiency requirements for cars ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
