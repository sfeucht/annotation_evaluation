This is the conclusion of a new scholarly paper . ##BASIC STATE
But how should this affect American literature ? ##QUESTION
Why are American literary voices so often pilloried for using their publications as substitutes for third party artists ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 ( e.g. authors , classical and contemporary artists ) ##OTHER
 in their argument or theme ? ##QUESTION
One explanation can be found in the work of Victoria Soderlund and Alexandre dos Ribeins , authors of The Final Familiar and The Eighth Typographic Reversal of Hemingway and Vermeer . ##BASIC STATE
Soderlund and dos Ribeins argue ##BASIC STATE
 that part of the problem is the historically inaccurate depiction of literature in its more explicit form , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that which is supposed to be based on the people involved ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and that too often seems to be based on either a joke or a suggestion ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that everything is fancy . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The authors point out ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that they have noticed another example : ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 how much the same literature influences Indian lit , literature with ongoing references to the struggles of women and children , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 children born without fathers . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
In the West , time for comparison between a savage or shining personality and an encyclopedic knowledge of a subject ##OTHER
 is greatly devalued , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 both in the sense ##OTHER
 that it is mistaken ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 to assume ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that everything in literature is gory , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and in the sense that it is merely another example of the myth of time . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They seem to say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that in their first world literature , ##OTHER
 tradition tries to line up both claims together ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and doesnt love ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to use them at all in a purely artistic way . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Their argument goes like this : ##BASIC STATE
 why do Indian and Pakistani novels and novels ##QUESTION
 that lie beyond chronological point of view ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 always seem to be the most considered of the key contemporary authors ? ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Why are American novels and novels popular with western audiences ##QUESTION
These are facts ##BASIC STATE
 which only critics ##OTHER
 ( and thus intellectual audiences ) ##OTHER
 can examine and categorize in reliable and analytic ways , no matter ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 how onerous and with corrupt personal and professional charges they seem , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 simply because they are what they are . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This is not a trivial point , ##BASIC STATE
 but Soderlund and dos Ribeins are on it . ##BASIC STATE*
The case of classical literature may have struck a chord , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 but did not inevitably find relevance in American and Indian media , among others ? ##BASIC STATE* //2
Most of the authors focused their arguments on explicit bodies of written language ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 ( eg , Leo Tolstoy ) ##OTHER
 and scarcely stretched as far as the precise meanings of literary ideas , especially those wholly related to the work of economics , economics , economics and economics ideas from the book or other approach ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)* //3
 which are the subject matter of the analysis . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The founders of non-fiction books sometimes claimed to investigate Americas behalf , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 but these authors used contradictory arguments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to bring to the reader a book ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that lay out the biggest obstacles to increasing writers . ##BASIC STATE*
Soderlund and dos Ribeins basically explained the arguments in this way , a bit like one half of a Bible , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 but that they were actually far more interesting than the other . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Although the author and reader alike might disagree on whether this was a good or bad idea , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 the arguments were very convincing , ##BASIC STATE
 as much as they were useful . ##BASIC STATE
I have no great problem with Soderlunds arguments , ##BASIC STATE
 or indeed I have any doubt their validity . ##BASIC STATE
Maybe this means American prose is a very old and very reliable form of literature in the 21st century . ##BASIC STATE
But I doubt ##BASIC STATE
 this is a great problem. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
