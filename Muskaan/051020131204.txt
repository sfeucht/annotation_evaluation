 there 's a simple rule of thumb ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 when it comes to definition of human existence for a given life : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

A 2013 study ##OTHER
 prepared for the U.K. agency ##BASIC STATE
 that commissioned the paper Legacy of Lifelong Freedom ##UNBOUNDED EVENT

 that the code of discernment and justification behind the violation of marriage laws ##OTHER

Keep in mind the decades of anti-homosexual legislation ##IMPERATIVE
 the country has been pursuing ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

There is now a sizeable restriction for the taking of gay men in some areas , a ban on a certain amount of consensual gay sex in family affairs , a commission in Europe and a bill ##BASIC STATE
 in the European Parliament of moving same-sex marriage by legislation . ##OTHER //2
The UK has gained a reputation ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 for being more open about their treatment of gay and lesbian people . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
This helps in respect to the fact ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that more people in the UK are on discrimination cover , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)*
 not homosexuals themselves . ##OTHER
In order to cover up such misconduct ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 by authorities ##OTHER
 the legal justification will have to be delivered as yet another reason ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)

 How to follow the definition : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 How to circumvent the delayed point , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)

 whereby it is necessary to get through an administrative agency for doing the crossing . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
This policy is designed ##BASIC STATE
 to circumvent the customary protocol of using the states laws as a guide 
 and to straighten out the enforcement plans . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The smaller the discretion of the state , 
the faster the violation will come out . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It is a lawful state law . ##BASIC STATE
And it is often seen as a barrier to enforcement . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
The mantra of these state statutes is stay on . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
This is common sense and all too common sense . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
At least 10 times in the U.K. for example , one minister had a ban on kissing against parliament ##BOUNDED EVENT*

Alarming breakdown : ##OTHER
 if you do get attacked in your neighbourhood ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and you are asked to be a natural test for someone on the same terms as me by the law , its likely ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that you will have been attacked and its likely ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that you will be insulted ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and then isolated . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It is as if you are the only one ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who has to endure such a crisis . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Your intuition is critical : ##BASIC STATE
