 The image of a court with a man ##OTHER
 with his teeth ##OTHER
 pinned behind him ##BASIC STATE
 should ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 have been famous in the 1920s . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But life is different now in Portugal ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( for it 's legal to make synthetic cannabis ) , ##BASIC STATE
 which is why it has n't come up for a licensing drive this year . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
Portugal The country is currently decriminalizing possession of cannabis for medicinal use , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 as seen in the cities of Lisbon and Castilla . ##BASIC STATE
The reform is also drawing criticism , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 with some claims ##OTHER
 it could lead to the introduction of legal hemp products , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 which are less ready to be grown than when harvested from the ground . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
But there 's a word for those fears . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Interestingly , a Portuguese Medicine Association report , ##OTHER
 including a link between the reports , ##BASIC STATE
 says ##BASIC STATE
 marijuana is also safer for humans than cocaine , a mixture of sexting , addictive gambling and criminal activity . ##BASIC STATE
Another reason might be that our beliefs about the link between them ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( kinesis , sexting , drugs ) ##OTHER
 are based on outdated assumptions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
" I do n't understand ##BASIC STATE
 how you could simply try and measure interest in marijuana from an economic point of view , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 " Professor Ben Woeller , a physician at Befrein is quoted as saying in the report . ##BASIC STATE
Worse still , we used to tell people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to come ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and medicate for other things , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 which makes us ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 hypocrites " ##OTHER
 There are many reasons for cannabis , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and although it is safe , ##BASIC STATE
 it is unclear what the actual effects would be on humans . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And the decision ##OTHER
 to medicate is perhaps more scientifically oriented , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 because the brains of some patients ##OTHER
 have the same problems ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as the brains of other populations , ##OTHER
 " is concluded . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //2
What 's interesting , however , ##BASIC STATE
 is that over 40 % of these studies were published in the press , not in the mainstream media , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 nor did they show ##NBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 how well people actually feel about both drugs . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
And generally , ##OTHER
 we do learn something new . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
" Perhaps that explains ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3 
 why there are still 20 years of coverage of marijuana as the subject of science fiction , ##BASIC STATE
 yet " exceptional " to the media . ##NONSENSE
But none of the doltis in drugs control ever says ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 " We just made them safe " , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 it 's enough to feel woefully blind . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
