It 's a bit complicated , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 with the FOGN ##OTHER
 known to include things like hallucinogenic cannabis and LSD in the models of Saturday Night Live . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
What about marijuana or drugs ##QUESTION
 related to sex ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It depends on how you define it ##BASIC STATE
 and who decides to use it . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
So here is one of the more obvious thoughts ##BASIC STATE
 I read in this piece , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and ##OTHER
 I feel ##BASIC STATE
 it applies to all sorts of drugs : ##BASIC STATE
 this is commonly thought of as people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 who dream up easy-to-use drugs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 say drinking tea over gay porn , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and making pizza with nachos in the morning . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Of course , ##OTHER
 this is a whole lot different , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and it makes me wonder ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 what role ##OTHER
 the Federal Drug Administration , ##OTHER
 which is the central FDA regulatory agency , ##BASIC STATE
 is taking in all of this : ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 FDA policy-makers have no authority ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 to review and modify drug design , development or safety . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Only regulations ##OTHER
 developed to address drug development , clinical development , safety , compliance , organizational reviews and licensing procedures are appropriate . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Of course , FDA policy-makers do not have the power ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 to reinstate prohibitions against drug development ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 based on clinical test results . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Interestingly , I never asked ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 what in the FOGN word legal about recreational marijuana ##NONSENSE
 use especially at this time of year , ##NONSENSE
 when the whole cabinet of people likes to say ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 it 's a terrible idea , ##BASIC STATE
 and when we collectively welcome medicinal marijuana in addition to recreational . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
You know , ##OTHER
 you save money by doing pot ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and it makes everyone more money . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But they do n't give much away : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 there 's no unlimited line items ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so the FTC has no power ##BASIC STATE
 to release its medicated records of cannabis use . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
And the government 's reach is limited : ##BASIC STATE
 there are no guidelines for these labs or that block list of drugs ##BASIC STATE
 on which you can buy medications in a federal marketplace , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 which meant ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 that they have no one ##BASIC STATE
 to base their own conclusions on in public hearings . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Today , ##OTHER
 I 've heard far less from politicians ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 than I have from people ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 who do n't have any fun at all from explaining the various ways ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 in which regulators can regulate drugs . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But what about the Congress , and what about ICE , ##QUESTION
 just in case ##OTHER
 you read this by mistake ? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
If you were ever stopped by ICE officers ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and your name was Solange , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and people are finding out ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 your name was Solange Rannoff , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 imagine the outcry ##IMPERATIVE
 if ICE arrests you without any of these other identifiers , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and reports ####COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that you were involved in sexual assault ? ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Imagine that . ##IMPERATIVE
Would the Federal Bureau of Investigation have a small mission in all those people ? ##QUESTION
Would ICE deny that applicant a visa ? ##QUESTION
Think back to its workforce in Tennessee ##IMPERATIVE
 and only six of the Top 100 employees remained . ##BASIC STATE
Or let 's just say ##IMPERATIVE
 they were never smart enough ##BASIC STATE
 to care about our job security . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
Hey , government is n't supposed to be a resource for free ideas . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The Federal Drug Administration is supposed to be a tool ##BASIC STATE
 for people 's very best and most important goal . ##OTHER
It has a power ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 to give people access to drugs and drug information in a way ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that 's seemingly free . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But it does n't give anyone power ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to do it , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 especially when it 's happening on a terrible day . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
So it 's best to play it safe , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 not so much that we 'll be ruined with any new drugs or cops on the streets , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but that we become more informed and curious about which drugs ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //2
 we 'll hit in the street in the future . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Here 's the last thing ##BASIC STATE
 I want to say about marijuana : ##BASIC STATE
 it 's a great idea , ##BASIC STATE
 and the Democrats will never be able to force marijuana to be legal again , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 because they wo n't support you , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 so there 's a good chance ##BASIC STATE
 in one way or another ##OTHER
 we 'll have to either be careful with it ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 or open up marijuana . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
And all of us ##OTHER
 who would consider making marijuana a reality or a default in drug regulation ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 should ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 rest in peace for a while , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that we 'll be blowing our hands out of our heads ##NONSENSE
 and going crazy all the time . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
