I have to agree about the constant slew of studies ##BASIC STATE
 that come up with new health benefits . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Seems a bit fishy to me . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Groups that fund studies usually have an agenda , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and that alone is enough ##BASIC STATE
 to skew studies towards finding results ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 they deem desirable . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It goes either way , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 a pro marijuana organization is n't going to pay for clinical trials ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that they think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 will show harmful benefits of cannabis consumption . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
It does have proven health benefits though , ##BASIC STATE
 It 's nausea , pain , and anxiety ##OTHER
 reducing ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 qualities alone are enough for most ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 to consider it medically valuable . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
With the rate ##OTHER
 that opiates and other dangerous drugs are getting doled out to people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 I do n't see anyway ##BASIC STATE
 you can consider that okay ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 but scoff at marijuana being medicine ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 That said , ##BASIC STATE

 marijuana is the lesser of all evils . ##BASIC STATE
Alcohol and tobacco have a long track record ##BASIC STATE
 of being more harmful in terms of health and domestic violence , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 alcohol especially seems like something ##BASIC STATE
 society could do without . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
If somebody out there smokes a joint and watches TV ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 instead of drinking a fifth ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and starting a fight ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 I would consider that a good thing . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
People are always going to want to get high ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and alter their consciousness ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and weed seems to be the safest way ##BASIC STATE
 to do that at this point in time . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Legalizing it just takes money from the cartels ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and back to the people , in the form of taxes and small business . ##OTHER
Marijuana ##OTHER
 being illegal did n't really stop people from smoking , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 just like prohibition did n't stop alcohol consumption . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Allowing the government to regulate the industry makes sure ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 you know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what you are smoking , as well . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
