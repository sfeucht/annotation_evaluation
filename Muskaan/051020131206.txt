This is not a reality ##BASIC STATE
 nor is it a fiction , ##BASIC STATE
 it is in the eternal struggle of Americans . ##BASIC STATE
There was the election of Trump , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 there was the rise of Trumpism , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 there was the marginalization of conservatives in the senate , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and there was a conservative minority in Congress . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The victorious Trump was the elected embodiment of this strange dichotomy , here in America , ##BASIC STATE
 we have some large , small , liberal states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 using anti-bureaucratic muscle and their unrealistic , empty dreams of national power and greater government . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
On paper we have all the answers , but then not in what is a complex and complicated system of governance , the bureaucracy , the political structures , democracy , and the partisanship ##BASIC STATE
 that governs politics , legislatures , and oversight . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Politicians , they should have been established many years ago with different virtues , different values , different ideologies , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 varying set of parameters and assumptions and language ##OTHER
 and they started out with one goal : ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to screw , demagogue , ruin , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and overthrow the working class . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The one goal of the non-trivialized Communist Party , the baddy ##OTHER
 who conspired with communists ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to orchestrate the downfall of the United States and then the Communist League , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 is the overthrow of the corrupt and corrupt elites , governments , power centers , civil liberties and basic security . ##BASIC STATE
So the first political experiment in modern American society is the systematic overthrow of the system of local government and the marginalization of powerful control over the product and liberties on all levels , ##BASIC STATE
 including the public goods , ##BASIC STATE
 including the services . ##BASIC STATE
Here is how you make it happen : ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 elected officials are controlled by local communities , legislatures , governors mansions , and senatorial representatives . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The federal government is therefore subordinate to local governments and the local control of their official interests . ##BASIC STATE
On the surface we know all the centralized control in our society , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but our model still requires redistribution , redistribution of wealth , redistribution of revenues , and redistribution of opportunity . ##BASIC STATE
Take love thy neighbor as an example : ##IMPERATIVE
 new universal health care system must be passed , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 constitutional amendments ##OTHER
 requiring all individuals to have insurance ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 are written and adopted to discourage the practice ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 of syphoning down benefits . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
These want to give in to the public demands of people desperate to see ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 if they can get a shot at a new life , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 because they cant afford the basic basic necessities ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 that it was not for them . ##NONSENSE
On the surface , yes but ##OTHER
 if you cut back the government power ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 you will end up diminishing the aggregate power of one unelected small group of people ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 who purport to be democrats . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The reach of this system , this world of government , is deeply fragmented and often ludicrous , a little like a small non-civilized family ##BASIC STATE
 looking at the dynamic of various political factions , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 drawing the outline of a less organized family . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
We need thoughtful monitoring ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of how the political norms can be more and more diverse , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 also changing the model of governance , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 even recognizing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that while one unitary system will have no actual power , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 the definition of separate and unable states may differ based on member number , demographic characteristics , hierarchy and interests . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
We need a federation of states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which coordinates our society . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
There are state governments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that are both conglomerates and supra-royal and quite the cool polytechnic kind of group . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are state and state-specific elections and a constitution ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that reflects their individual communities and international alliances . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You will find too many such councils to really have a role in making a well-rounded state , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 but there are two possibilities ##BASIC STATE
 that may emerge , one ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 being pragmatic states like Utah and Vermont ##BASIC STATE
 that start out producing the goods ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that everyone needs , ##BASIC STATE
 that also have direct influence over the results of local races . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Each one , however , should be mindful of the differences among its population groups , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) 
 and that also allows state-level branches of politics . ##BASIC STATE
I could go on and on but my preference is to conserve as much power as possible , ##BASIC STATE
 limit the right of anyone on any level of government ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to control every aspect of our society ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 to subsidize the legislators of our elected representatives , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 to set the terms of basic liberty in a sound and rational way , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to ensure ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that the state never has too much influence on everything but the economic interests of the state , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to not default to the status quo , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 or to independence . ##OTHER
