This is not a reality ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 nor is it a fiction , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 it is in the eternal struggle of Americans . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There was the election of Trump , ##BASIC STATE //3
 there was the rise of Trumpism , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 there was the marginalization of conservatives in the senate , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 and there was a conservative minority in Congress . ##BASIC STATE
The victorious Trump was the elected embodiment of this strange dichotomy , ##BASIC STATE
 here in America , ##OTHER
 we have some large , small , liberal states ##BASIC STATE
 using anti-bureaucratic muscle and their unrealistic , empty dreams of national power and greater government . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
On paper we have all the answers , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
but then not in what is a complex and complicated system of governance , the bureaucracy , the political structures , democracy , and the partisanship ##BASIC STATE
 that governs politics , legislatures , and oversight . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Politicians , they should have been established many years ago with different virtues , different values , different ideologies , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 varying set of parameters and assumptions and language ##OTHER
 and they started out with one goal : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to screw , demagogue , ruin , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and overthrow the working class . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
The one goal of the non-trivialized Communist Party , ##OTHER
 the baddy  who conspired with communists ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 to orchestrate the downfall of the United States and then the Communist League , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 is the overthrow of the corrupt and corrupt elites , governments , power centers , civil liberties and basic security . ##BASIC STATE
So the first political experiment in modern American society is the systematic overthrow of the system of local government and the marginalization of powerful control over the product and liberties on all levels , ##BASIC STATE
 including the public goods , ##BASIC STATE
 including the services . ##BASIC STATE
Here is how you make it happen : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 elected officials are controlled by local communities , legislatures , governors mansions , and senatorial representatives . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The federal government is therefore subordinate to local governments and the local control of their official interests . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
On the surface we know all the centralized control in our society , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but our model still requires redistribution , redistribution of wealth , redistribution of revenues , and redistribution of opportunity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Take love thy neighbor as an example : ##IMPERATIVE
 new universal health care system must be passed , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 constitutional amendments ##OTHER
 requiring all individuals to have insurance ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 are written and adopted to discourage the practice ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 of syphoning down benefits . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
These want to give in to the public demands of people desperate to see ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 if they can get a shot at a new life , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because they cant afford the basic basic necessities ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that it was not for them . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
On the surface , yes but ##OTHER
 if you cut back the government power ##UNBOUNDED EVENT
 you will end up diminishing the aggregate power of one unelected small group of people ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 who purport to be democrats . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The reach of this system , this world of government , is deeply fragmented and often ludicrous , 
a little like a small non-civilized family ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 looking at the dynamic of various political factions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 drawing the outline of a less organized family . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
We need thoughtful monitoring ##BASIC STATE
 of how the political norms can be more and more diverse , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
 also changing the model of governance , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 even recognizing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that while one unitary system will have no actual power , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 the definition of separate and unable states may differ based on member number , demographic characteristics , hierarchy and interests . ##BASIC STATE
We need a federation of states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which coordinates our society . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
There are state governments ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that are both conglomerates and supra-royal and quite the cool polytechnic kind of group . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are state and state-specific elections and a constitution ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that reflects their individual communities and international alliances . ##BASIC STATE
You will find too many such councils to really have a role in making a well-rounded state , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but there are two possibilities ##BASIC STATE
 that may emerge , one ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 being pragmatic states like Utah and Vermont ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that start out producing the goods  that everyone needs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that also have direct influence over the results of local races . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Each one , however , should be mindful of the differences among its population groups , 
 and that also allows state-level branches of politics . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I could go on and on 
but my preference is to conserve as much power as possible , ##BASIC STATE
 limit the right of anyone on any level of government ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to control every aspect of our society ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to subsidize the legislators of our elected representatives , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to set the terms of basic liberty in a sound and rational way , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to ensure ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that the state never has too much influence on everything but the economic interests of the state , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 to not default to the status quo , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 or to independence . ##OTHER
