A lot of your argument seems to be based on a comparison between marijuana and other drugs . ##BASIC STATE
But the problem is , ##BASIC STATE
 most drugs are n't comparable to marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You suppose ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that heroin would gain a level of illegal production ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 to match ##OTHER
 what marijuana 's has become , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and I just ca n't wrap my head about why you think ##BASIC STATE
 that might be . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
There are n't many heroin or meth users out there developing a hobbyist 's interest ##BASIC STATE
 in producing their drug . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Or the idea ##OTHER
 that use of heroin or meth will maintain or increase at legalization , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and I certainly do n't believe that . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The crowd ##OTHER
 that is n't doing meth and heroin are n't avoiding it because of legal repercussions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
While legal marijuana almost definitely increased the rate of marijuana DUI cases , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 I find it a similarly hollow claim ##BASIC STATE
 that heroin and meth users would cause more DUIs ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if it was legal . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Perhaps some , ##OTHER
 but again , marijuana is n't like meth and heroin . ##BASIC STATE
Marijuana DUI cases are likely as high ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as they are because it 's so easy ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for so many to get away with it . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I do n't necessarily believe ##BASIC STATE
 that there 's going to be thousands of meth heads mixed into my traffic ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if they only thing ##OTHER
 they have to fear is a DUI . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Nor can the War on Drugs take credit for ancillary crimes ##BASIC STATE
 found ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 when chasing drugs . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
They would still be illegal , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and we 'd all agree ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 it still should be pursued and stopped . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
There 's no reason ##BASIC STATE
 to think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 cops are powerless ##BASIC STATE
 unless they are chasing drugs . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
At the end of the day though , none of it touches on the real true failings of the War on Drugs . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
In the world of narcotics law enforcement , ##OTHER
 there are n't victims . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are users and dealers . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Treating drug addiction like a health problem ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and trying to solve it as such ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 is proven ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to be more effective than punitive punishments , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and you simply cannot balance a medical approach ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 while at the same time pursuing criminal charges against drug users . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Legalizing all drugs is n't going to solve the drug problem , ##BASIC STATE
 it 's a necessary first step ##BASIC STATE
 to solutions ##OTHER
 that actually work . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
